* Public API for duplex streams in MockWebServer

I'm not 100% on the name 'Stream' for the source+sink pair. It's
tempting to use 'Socket', though I think that's an implementation name
and this is an abstraction that uses a different implementation.

I've chosen Stream specifically 'cause it's the word used in the
HTTP/2 spec. My biggest gripe with it is that it's bidirectional
in the HTTP/2 spec, but Java InputStream and OutputStream are not
bidirectional.

* Create MockResponseBody

We'd previously only ever used Buffer to model the type
of the MockResponse body. This has proven inadequate, particularly
for features like duplex responses.

Most of the complexity in this PR is changing how throttling
and disconnect-during-body work when we don't necessarily have
a Buffer for the response body.

This is a first step, more capability to follow.

* Make jvm functions compatible with kotlin 1.5 runtime

Based on the discovery in https://github.com/square/okhttp/pull/7329#issuecomment-1159192273
this commit tries a different approach to make okhttp compatible
with the kotlin 1.5 runtime. Specifically, it converts the DurationUnit
instance to a java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit instance and uses the
existing codepath to handle it. The conversion must be done without
using `DurationUnit.toTimeUnit()` since that is again a function
that would not exist in the 1.5 kotlin runtime environment.",0.7,None,None

Our path building is very naive and it's possible to cause OkHttp to
create chains that are different from the chains previously verified
by the SSL engine.

Our preference is to use the platform's chain where possible. This includes
Android API 17+, which has an API that returns the actual chain that
was verified, not the (potentially larger) set of certificates served
by the server.

We should further lock down our chain processing. I'm reluctant to do
full graph building because it's a lot of ugly code and potentially
expensive. For now, a test that attempts to detect gaps between what
the TLS layer lets through and what our chain cleaner computes.",0.7,None,None

Also rename okhttp3.mockwebserverwrapper to okhttp3.mockwebserver

Directories are not renamed to minimize the git diff. That'll follow
in a separate commit.

Most users of the API are not impacted. The ones that are:
 - CallTest subclasses QueueDispatcher
 - DuplexTest uses duplex APIs
 - HttpOverHttp2Test subclasses QueueDispatcher

620,02ac2f38e8f8dacebb090dcf7f7eb30ed29d4fc7,Jesse Wilson,jesse@swank.ca,"MockWebServer wrapper (#6326)

This is step 1 of a plan to break MockWebServer's dependency on JUnit 4.

1. New module, mockwebserverwrapper: implement almost all of the mockwebserver
   API by delegating to the real mockwebserver API.

2. Swap the names. Rename the package okhttp3.mockwebserver to mockwebserver3,
   and rename okhttp3.mockwebserverwrapper to okhttp3.mockwebserver. With this
   rename all users of MockWebServer are now using the wrapper instead.

3. Change mockwebserver3 to not depend on JUnit 4.

4. Migrate callers from the okhttp3.mockwebserver wrapper to mockwebserver3,
   dropping their JUnit dependency along the way. It may take a very long time
   for callers to migrate. That's okay; the wrapper isn't much code to maintain.

Notable breaks in binary compatibility:

 - Duplex is not supported in the wrapper. This was never intended as public
   API.
 - QueueDispatcher cannot be subclassed in the wrapper. Supporting this is
   rather annoying because we need to support reverse wrapping and unwrapping.
   I think it's not worth the effort.",0.2,None,None

it encounters a tag it can't understand, it assumes it's own value has

Fix DiskLruCache to work on Windows",0.2,None,None

788,64d3b079f292bdddb28a264ec1addbb84791df85,Jesse Wilson,jwilson@squareup.com,"Fix DiskLruCache to work on Windows

As originally designed DiskLruCache assumes an inode-like
file system, where it's fine to delete files that are
currently being read or written.

On Windows the file system forbids this, so we must be
more careful when deleting and renaming files. These
operations come up a lot internally in the cache:
 - deleting to evict an entry
 - renaming to commit a dirty file to a clean file

The workaround is simple if unsatisfying: we don't
permit concurrent reads and writes on Windows. We
can have multiple concurrent reders, or a single
writer.

One challenge in this implementation is detecting
whether we're running on Windows or a good operating
system. We deliberately don't look at System properties
here because the OS and file system may disagree, such
as when a Windows machine has an ext4 partition, or when
a Linux machine has an NTFS partition. Instead of detecting
we just attempt an edit and see what happens.

Another challenge in this implementation is what to
do when a file needs to be deleted but cannot be because
it is currently open. In such cases we now mark the
cache entry as a 'zombie'. When the files are later
closed they now check for zombie status and delete the
files if necessary. Note that it is not possible to
store a new cache entry while it is a zombie.

From the project's release notes:

    Defects Fixed

    DLExternal would encode using DER encoding for tagged SETs. This has been fixed.
    ChaCha20Poly1305 could fail for large (>~2GB) files. This has been fixed.
    ChaCha20Poly1305 could fail for small updates when used via the provider. This has been fixed.
    Properties.getPropertyValue could ignore system property when other local overrides set. This has been fixed.
    The entropy gathering thread was not running in daemon mode, meaning there could be a delay in an application shutting down due to it. This has been fixed.
    A recent change in Java 11 could cause an exception with the BC Provider's implementation of PSS. This has been fixed.
    BCJSSE: TrustManager now tolerates having no trusted certificates.
    BCJSSE: Choice of credentials and signing algorithm now respect the peer's signature_algorithms extension properly.
    BCJSSE: KeyManager for KeyStoreBuilderParameters no longer leaks memory.

    Additional Features and Functionality

    LMS and HSS (RFC 8554) support has been added to the low level library and the PQC provider.
    SipHash128 support has been added to the low level library and the JCE provider.
    BCJSSE: BC API now supports explicitly specifying the session to resume.
    BCJSSE: Ed25519, Ed448 are now supported when TLS 1.2 or higher is negotiated (except in FIPS mode).
    BCJSSE: Added support for extended_master_secret system properties: jdk.tls.allowLegacyMasterSecret, jdk.tls.allowLegacyResumption, jdk.tls.useExtendedMasterSecret .
    BCJSSE: Ed25519, Ed448 are now supported when TLS 1.2 or higher is negotiated (except in FIPS mode).
    BCJSSE: KeyManager and TrustManager now check algorithm constraints for keys and certificate chains.
    BCJSSE: KeyManager selection of server credentials now prefers matching SNI hostname (if any).
    BCJSSE: KeyManager may now fallback to imperfect credentials (expired, SNI mismatch).
    BCJSSE: Client-side OCSP stapling support (beta version: via status_request extension only, provides jdk.tls.client.enableStatusRequestExtension, and requires CertPathBuilder support).
    TLS: DSA in JcaTlsCrypto now falls back to stream signing to work around NoneWithDSA limitations in default provider.

Our original expectations were that KitKat devices would age out in
2020. It's been a garbage year and this expectations no longer hold.
We're extending support an extra year.

We continue to support OkHttp 3.12.x because later releases are not
usable on older devices and JVMs.

OkHttp 3.14.x has no such reason to receive support, and we'll stop
updating it on June 30, 2020. Users of OkHttp 3.14.x should upgrade
to the 4.x series. Android apps should accept Kotlin libraries; it's
the platform's future. And JVM apps are less constrained by binary
size. Here's the size of OkHttp + transitive dependencies, and those
of alternatives:

 * OkHttp 4.4: 2.47 MiB including Kotlin stdlib (1.51 MiB)
 * Apache HTTP Client 5.0: 1.78 MiB including slf4j-api (0.04 MiB)

We attempt to minimize connection and reconnection work, but in this case we
were overly aggressive about retaining the same connection. In some deployments
services will share certificates but not DNS addresses; when redirecting
between such services we were incorrectly attempting to reuse the connection.

Formalize the lifecycle of Exchange",0.2,None,None

896,0d09dc123850a7cd3583ff2ccbde89cac0712275,Jesse Wilson,jwilson@squareup.com,"Formalize the lifecycle of Exchange

There's four useful events:

1. When we're ready to call network interceptors. At this point
   we expect an exchange to exist, as a handle to the connection
   we've chosen for the network call

2. When we hold an exchange that must later be released.

3. When we release the exchange

4. When we're done calling network interceptors. Only at this point
   do we no longer need to remember what the exchange was and what
   connection it used.

In practice 1 and 2 happen mostly at the same time. Right now 1 is
in RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor and 2 is in ConnectInterceptor, but
we should be able to move those around without pain.

But we have a problem with 3 and 4. If the response has no response
body, then 3 will precede 4. We will release the exchange as soon as
we know there's no streams held. This means that network interceptors,
including our own RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor, do not consistently
have an exchange after they've called proceed(). This is problematic
if they want to make decisions based on what connection was used.

I've added a new member, 'interceptorScopedExchange' that holds the
exchange from 1 and 2 through 4, regardless of when 3 happens.

This is all working towards a solution to handling HTTP 421s on
coalesced connections.

This changes the timing of responseHeaderStart and responseBodyStart events to
fire when bytes are received from the server. This is a non-trivial behavior
change and should be documented as such in the release notes. In particular,
the responseFailed event may be fired without a preceding responseHeadersStart
event.

To test this I've added a timestamp to our CallEvent test facet.

This probably should have been the case all along. Unfortunately,
ExecutorService Runnables are not cancelable by default, and that's
where we started.

After implementing all of TaskRunner it looks like where we're
cancelable and where we aren't is totally arbitrary. Making everything
cancelable simplifies the implementation and model.

The last remaining non-cancelable tasks:
 * awaitIdle() which we use in our tests only.
 * MockWebServer, where canceling would leak sockets",0.7,None,None

Now we don't have to alternate between the coordinator thread and the task
thread between task runs if the task returns 0. Instead the task thread can
stay resident.

This implementation works by having task runnables that can switch from
the coordinator role (sleeping until the next task starts) and the executor
role.

It now tracks inbound requests that fail with an IOException.

Also add a fix for the bug where we'd send 'END OF STREAM' on a stream
that we'd previously canceled, which raced with the 'RST STREAM' and led
to flakiness.

Before we ship the new API in RecordedRequest we should go over the
other cases where inbound HTTP requests fail and make sure they
get reported through this channel.

I want to tighten up our executors for a few reasons
 - Fix daemon vs. non-daemon problems
 - Fix code unloading problems
 - Be able to wait for async work to complete in tearDown()
 - Fewer threads for pongs, acks, and window updates

This shouldn't be too much to layer on top of ExecutorService, but
it is not easy to do with those APIs alone.

The underlying motivation is to make scheduling work easier in
Http2Connection, which will help with differentiating between

MockWebServer sometimes enforces the DISCONNECT_AFTER_REQUEST policy before the client executes exchange.finishRequest(). As a result, Http2Writer.flush() is called on a closed Http2Writer and throws. This causes a RequestFailed event to be emitted instead of the expected ResponseFailed.

This change enforces the de-facto sequence in most runs, where the policy is applied only after the client finishes writing the request.

The test is flaky because the server sometimes acts on the 301 response and resets the stream before the action added by MockDuplexResponseBody.sendResponse() is executed. This action then fails because it tries to write to a reset stream. mockDuplexResponseBody.awaitSuccess() then throws and fails the test.

The test fails when there is a context switch to the MockWebServer thread after the client sends the HEADERS frame but before it sends the DATA frame. The MockWebServer then reads the client's HEADER frame and sends a DATA frame with the response body. As a result, the first DATA frame that is logged is not the expected empty DATA frame sent by the client.

This addresses the following observed failure modes and reduces the flakinesss of the test:

1. On most runs, the first request is canceled before the client starts to read the response body. In some runs, it's canceled after the client starts to read the response body and the first call doesn't fail as expected.

2. The first request is sometimes canceled before the server dequeues the first mocked response. That response, which is set to send a body after a 10 second delay, is then used to respond to the second request, which triggers the 5 second test timeout.

ServerSocketFactory.getDefault() will load the default JVM truststore
(typically from jre/lib/security/cacerts) as configured by JSSE
system properties.

However, a typical use case for setting a custom ServerSocketFactory is
that the client application has loaded custom keystore or truststore
material into their JVM, usually by creating a custom SSLContext.

There's strictly no reason to initialize the default ServerSocketFactory
until the mockwebserver has been started, allowing custom settings of the
factory by clients and avoiding the default load attempt during class
construction.

This patch simply moves the initiatlization logic into the private start
method to avoid the premature loading of trust store materials.",0.7,None,None

There are usually 2 requests sent to '/b' during the test:
#1 on the busted connection, attempting reuse
#2 on a new connection

On successful runs, the server recorded #1 and then #2 and added them to the queue in that order.

On failed runs, the server started reading request #1 before #2, but there was a context switch, and it finished reading #2 before #1, recording them in that order. Since #1 was the last to be recorded, the test incorrectly used it to assert that the sequence number was 0. Since #1 was the second to be received on the busted connection, it had a sequence number of 1 so the test failed.

The fix removes the assumption that #2 is the last to be recorded.

Strictly-speaking this change is backwards-incompatible because it adds
a new method to the Call interface. The method returns the call's timeout.

The trickiest part of this is signaling the end of the call, which
occurs after the last byte is consumed of the last follow up request,
or when the call fails. Fortunately this is made easier by borrowing
the sites used by EventListener, which already plots out where calls
end.

The drawbacks seem small; the callsite needs to handle interruption anyway
because the thread is prone to interruption.

And the upside is that a single interrupt should now be sufficient to break
out an in-flight OkHttp call.

Note that although we're fixing this, thread interruption is not well tested
in OkHttp. Most users should prefer Call.cancel(), which is well tested and
doesn't rely on the caller to know which threads OkHttp is using to make
the actual HTTP request.

This removes the Ping abstraction from our http2 package. This was written as
if it were a public API, but never exposed to any callers but tests. Removing
it makes it easier to lock down how pings are used.

This also removes the NullServer class, replacing it with a new SocketPolicy
on MockWebServer. The new SocketPolicy, STALL_SOCKET_AT_START, allows us to
do TLS and negotiate an HTTP/2 connection without actually building a proper
Http2Connection and without responding to pings.

The behavior in HTTP/2 connections is modeled after our behavior in web sockets.
We count outgoing pings, incoming pongs, and confirm that the pongs are keeping
up. If later we make this policy more sophisticated we can track the changes
in both places.

This changes the executor services in HTTP/2 connection to split up
listener executors (of which there may be many threads) from writer
executors (of which there is one per connection).

This adds a scheduled executor job to send pings on an interval. We
don't yet fail the connection if pongs are not received.

This changes the executor services in HTTP/2 connection to split up
listener executors (of which there may be many threads) from writer
executors (of which there is one per connection).

This adds a scheduled executor job to send pings on an interval. We
don't yet fail the connection if pongs are not received.

There are several options for when to expect the pong response. I've

This is useful when accessing a web server you don't control which receives form data
encoded in a charset other than UTF-8 (e.g. ISO-8859-1).

To use this you pass an encoding to FormBody.Builder constructor. The constructor is used so
it's clear you shouldn't switch encodings in the middle of building a form body.

result of Java's String.getBytes(charset) is also undefined in that case.

Prior to commit 084b06b48bae2b566bb1be3415b6c847d8ea3682 (OkHttp 3.4.0),
a HttpURLConnection.disconnect() in the middle of connecting caused an
infinite loop. HUC does not claim to be thread safe, but concurrent
disconnect should generally be supported (it is supported by HttpEngine)
and this bug occurred even when the disconnect() happened in the same
thread, e.g. through the CookieJar.

The infinite loop prior to that CL occurred because
 - The loop in HttpURLConnectionImpl.java:418 did not check for the
   disconnected state,
 - {StreamAllocation,RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor}.recover() returns
   true for canceled StreamAllocations/calls, but
   StreamAllocation.newStream() immediately fails if already canceled.

This bug was specific to HUC and did not affect the Call API because
RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor's (and, in earlier OkHttp versions,
Call.getResponse()'s) infinite loop did check the canceled case
before proceeding.

The bug existed since at least OkHttp 2.7.5, likely introduced by
commit c358656c8799d30fd422448153e99a5dd37e298a (OkHttp 2.7.0).

The new test asserts that a disconnect() while constructing the
cookie headers leads to the new connection being aborted. It would
also be permissible for the connection to succeed (as long as it
doesn't deadlock like it used to), but the stricter test seems
reasonable to ensure that any behavior change is deliberate.
A disconnect() while accessing the Cache FileSystem has the same
effect, but this is not covered by the added test because a
new FileSystem wrapper class that delegates all calls would
create code maintenance overhead.",0.7,None,None

2618,27ece261726695fc7d1b5fa95fabf1798fd0a409,Tobias Thierer,tobiast@google.com,"Fix Connection sharing across equivalent OkHttpClients

Fixes https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/2757

The OkHttpClient(Builder) constructor and both overloads of
OkHttpClient.Builder.sslSocketFactory() set a new CertificateChainCleaner
instance on the OkHttpClient.

Before this CL, CertificateChainCleaner, CertificatePinner and
TrustRootIndex used object rather than value identity semantics. This
caused Address.equals() to not recognize when addresses were equivalent,
which broke connection pooling across OkHttpClient instances.

This CL changes CertificateChainClaner, CertificatePinner and
TrustRootIndex to use value equality by overriding equals() and hashCode().

CertificatePinner.pins and BasicTrustRootIndex.subjectToCaCerts's values
have changed from List to Set because their order shouldn't matter.
This CL uses LinkedHashSet, although HashSet should also work.",0.7,None,None

These three methods were delegating to delegate; their implementation
was duplicated across both subclasses of DelegatingHttpsURLConnection.

This change moves them into the base class in order to
  - avoid duplication
  - separate the responsibility of delegation (base class) from the
    responsibility of change to behavior (subclasses).

Notes:
 - Since these three methods are not available in Java 6, each of
   these need a @IgnoreJRERequirement annotation to pass the
   animal sniffer test. This appears like it should have been
   necessary before but for some reason it used to pass without.
 - This in turn requires a new dependency from okhttp-urlconnection
   onto animal-sniffer-annotations. The dependency was added onto

This allows Handshake to accept CipherSuite names that do not have a

that conscrypt uses today or might use in future.

The following OkHttp 3 APIs are not changed by this CL:

 - ConnectionSpec still uses Strings to represent CipherSuites for now.

 - CipherSuites are interned (value equality is based on object
   equality) in order to not break clients that use ==.

This CL does introduce these API and behavioral changes:
 - CipherSuite instances constructed via CipherSuite.forJavaName(""TLS_"" + s)
   will now always be different from CipherSuite.forJavaName(""SSL_"" + s)
   for all possible values of s. Previously, there were 19 specific
   values of s for which those would have yielded equal instances.
 - Since CipherSuite is no longer an enum, it no longer extends Enum,
   no longer has name() or valueOf() methods, and no longer implements
   Serializable.

The wiring is definitely a bit more awkward than I would like. The
CertificateAuthorityCountil is a non-public class, and this change
sneaks an instance into the CertificatePinner that couples it to
the OkHttp client's SSLSocketFactory.

A nicer solution is to expose CertificateAuthorityCouncil as a public
API type, and add it to Address.java. Unfortunately that's currently
pretty awkward, especially because I'm not ready to commit to the
name CertificateAuthorityCouncil or its API.

Right now there's problems with our ability to confirm certificate pins with
root certificates because we don't actually know which certificate authority
was used.

This unblocks that work.

This code is particularly fragile and gross. There's no API to get the
TrustManager from an SSLSocketFactory. We can potentially change the way
that we compute the initial SSLSocketFactory, but this approach is most
general.

There's a big consequence to this for compatible with RFC 2965 Cookies. In particular,
this drops our ability to support 'Set-Cookie2' headers, and some features used there
including quoted attributes like 'Max-Age=""25""'. This is the right move for interop with
browsers, and likely to make things better for application developers, but some
people who strictly followed the RFC 2965 spec will be broken. (That spec was never
seriously adopted anywhere, which is the entire motivation of RFC 6265.)

There's a few places where OkHttp could leak a connection that needed to be
closed. With our new connection pool model this is easier to find. This fixes
two specific problems:
 - too many redirects doesn't release the last used connection

The test relies on small client send / server receive buffers
to force blocking and generate a timeout.

The switch to make MockWebServer a @Rule (commit
785d9e94387f404f571775a49c3a9438508bb659) moved the
MockWebServer.start() call earlier in the test execution.
Setting the ServerSocketFactory became a no-op so the server
receive buffer size was left as the default.

The test became reliant on either:
1) The default server socket receive buffer being small enough
(e.g. less than the data being transmitted).
2) The device being too slow to send the requested data in the
time allowed.

The test was recently made less reliable by:
1) The okio commit
f30955cb15eb234f874dd55819686832c960765b, which made the segment
size bigger (increasing throughput / transfer efficiency).
2) The OkHttp commit f30955cb15eb234f874dd55819686832c960765b,
which reduced the amount of data being sent in the test from
16MB to 2MB.
3) Recent Android devices have large default buffer sizes. e.g.
Nexus 5: 1MB, Nexus 5X: 6MB.",0.7,None,None

Related to issue #1790.

If there is a *connection* timeout the next route should
be tried. Timeouts during a request/response should
probably not be retried.

The timeout/interrupt behavior was changed in PR #1257
for issue #1146. This modified both connection and
request/response behavior. The issue reported was actually
about the use of Thread.interrupt(), not timeouts, but the
behavior change modified both behavior for interrupt and
timeout.

PR #1388 split the handling of exceptions so that separate
code now handles connection errors from that which handles
request/response errors. It faithfully kept the behavior
from PR #1257.

The modification of the timeout behavior during *connection*
caused problems on Android. Now that the two types of error
handling are split it's possible to deal with them
differently and return the connection behavior to trying
the next route. This does not modify behavior during
request/response.",0.7,None,None

We had a bug where the socket-being-connected wasn't being closed when the
application used Call.cancel(). The problem is that the SocketConnector model
assumes the Connection doesn't want a Socket instance until it's fully
connected.

This moves the SocketConnector code back into Connection, removes a lot of
nested try/catch blocks, and assigns a Socket instance as soon as its created.

This also likely fixes some bugs where sockets weren't being closed when
an IOException or RouteException was thrown during connection. Now we always
close at the top level of connect() unless the connection is successful.

make the DiskLruCache's initialize() public through the Cache interface

The DiskLruCache’s cache does lazy initialization. The time spent in
initialization varies depending on the actual cache size and journal
file size.

On very low end device, the initialization time could be as long as
1000 ms once the cache reaches 100M for example on a 4.0 device. This
has significant performance impact on the very 1st cache hit.

So the proposed solution is to give the developer an opportunity to
explicitly do the initialization early on and in a back ground thread.
Without this change, the developer would have to call any method from
the Cache class to warm up the cache implicitly.",0.7,None,None

Keep the embedded OkHttp on Android working with Vary headers:

Vary headers were broken with android.net.http.HttpResponseCache:
the OkHttp caching requires a networkResponse to check the vary
headers and it was not being provided, leading to a
NullPointerException. Further changes were needed to actually
retain the request headers needed for the vary check itself.

Support for other stacks using the RequestCache has been
dropped for requests that include Vary headers.

To avoid regressions the existing ResponseCacheTest has been
changed to use the real cache. Previously, the use of
InMemoryResponseCache was hiding the Vary problem.

The ResponseCacheTest is now run with an AndroidShimResponseCache
to prove the tests work with real cases. The case without the shim
is covered with the CacheTest. ResponseCacheTest has been updated
to include many tests from CacheTest that were missing.

Switching the test to a real cache revealed a problem in the
JavaApiConverter and bad headers, which has been fixed by
making Headers.Builder.addLenient(String, String) accessible.",0.7,None,None

(effectively a {proxy, socket address} pair), rather than just
one attempt. i.e. Connection now handles all the TLS negotiation
fallbacks internally.

2) Route no longer deals with TLS versions. Individual TLS
failures are not counted against a Route. If no connection
attempts to a route were successful the failure is counted
against the route.

3) The code makes a distinction between when various

To my great delight, Java and Android can read .pem files without
the BKS or JKS store files we typically use to distribute trusted
certificates.

This recipe includes a big copy-and-pasteable method for converting
an InputStream of PEM files into an SSLContext. The rest of it is
warnings about how dangerous that is.

Combined with an NPN bug (18705877) on Android this is the
reason why fallback connections started failing on Android
after the COMPATIBLE_TLS was changed to be TLSv1.

[The NPN bug means that once enabled on a socket from an
SSLContext then NPN must be configured for every subsequent
socket otherwise some of the NPN state will still be set,
but some will be missing, leading to negotiation issues].

The implication of this change is that the follow up request
after a handshake failure may now be HTTP/2 or SPDY

have been HTTP/1.1.

Motivation 1: Cipher selection and TLS protocol version selection
should be performed over ""enabled"", not ""support"" values. Otherwise,
ciphers / protocols that are disabled by default are re-enabled.
Android would like to avoid enabling values that are considered unsafe
and are disabled by the platform, apps or GMS core.

Motivation 2: Opinionated cipher suite selection makes sense for
OkHttp when bundled with apps. OkHttp probably has the best/newest
information available when compared with the socket factory it
encounters.

However, with the Android platform usecase the socket factory (i.e.
one from the platform, from GMS core, or installed by the app) might
have better information (or reasons why specific suites should not be
used and so it modifies the ""enabled"" set). Android would therefore
prefer OkHttp to select from a default set specified by the socket
factory, not a list hard-coded at release time.

Unlike ciphers, for protocols there is no current need to
go with the default enabled set so supporting ""null"" / ""use default""
is not required for protocols.

Other change:

The ConnectionSpec caching (see supportedSpec) has been removed from
ConnectionSpec. This seems like an risky optimization to me in an
environment where different SocketFactory instances could be encountered
and doing it properly seems costly and of limited benefit.",0.7,None,None

Ultimate goal: to improve the TLS fallback behavior so that

RequestBody.contentLength() doesn't necessarily catch or declare
IOException, and will need to with this change.

MultipartBuilder is most impacted by this change; previously the
length was computed eagerly; now it's not computed at all.

buffer the request bodies and use that to compute the length.

When the preferred Android network changes from
cell -> wifi or wifi -> cell the HTTP connection
pool in use is abandoned to avoid reuse of
connections on the old network. This was added
in commit 8bced3e.

The design for the connection pool was such that
continuous use of the connection pool was required to
clean up idle / expired connections. If a connection
pool becomes idle (as when it is dereferenced on a
network change) it is possible for some connections
to remain in the pool indefinitely.

After the preferred network change, because the old
connection pool was no longer referenced the pool
would be garbage collected and Android's ""Strict Mode""
would complain about sockets not being closed.

The only existing way to avoid this was to call
""evictAll()"", which would have had issues when a
large number of connections were returned to the pool
after evictAll() was called. It also wouldn't work
for SPDY connections which are shared but not reference
counted, which makes knowing whether it is safe to
close them difficult.

The cleanModeRunnable serves two purposes:

1) While scheduled / executing, it pins the connection
pool in memory to avoid it being garbage collected.
2) It continues to close connections (safely) until the
pool is empty.

If a connection is then added back to the pool the
cleanModeRunnable is restarted.",0.7,None,None

When the proxy was specified as an IP address the RouteSelector would force

result in the original IP address not being given priority and
connection attempts being made to IPs besides the one specified by the
original Proxy specifier.

This change distinguishes between whether the proxy InetSocketAddress is
specified with a string, or with an InetAddress. This is referred to as
""unresolved"" and ""resolved"" respectively. If an InetAddress is present
we assume we should use that single address to communicate with the
proxy.

This relies on the InetSocketAddress being created ""unresolved"": if the
InetSocketAddress is created from a hostname but created ""resolved"",
the InetAddress is filled in and OkHttp will interpret that as an

3844,cbd185f592f59c23a650635041761199f12ce64f,Neil Fuller,nfuller@google.com,"Modify bad CONNECT handling

Changing the way that OkHttp handles CONNECT responses
from proxies.

Before the change:
If a proxy returns a body and some of the body bytes have
already been buffered then an IOException is thrown.
If the body bytes have not been buffered then the handshake will
fail due to the presence of bytes where the Server HELLO is
expected, typically with some kind of SSLHandshakeException.

After the change:
The body bytes are consumed to ensure consistent behavior. The
handshake will then take place.

History:
This is an unusual case that would occasionally cause failures
on Android when a ResponseCache was installed. Android introduced
a patch to prevent CONNECT responses being cached. Since then,
OkHttp has changed the code and probably fixed the issue via
other means. The Android test remained and would sometimes
experience one exception, sometimes another, depending on the
state of the buffer.

If the presence of a body is a possibility it would be nice
to deal with it consistently and deterministically.

The motivation for this change is to make
URLConnectionTest#connectViaHttpProxyToHttpsUsingBadProxyAndHttpResponseCache
behave consistently and in a way that doesn't involve connection
fallback.

The only risk with this change is if a proxy is incorrectly
reporting the content length: this might lead to blocking on
the body read/skip (as OkHttp would probably do elsewhere if a
server mis-reports a content-length). This change may make
connections to ""bad"" proxies slightly more reliable.",0.7,None,None

An HTTP client interacts with the network in two main ways: DNS
lookups and connections to HTTP servers. OkHttp already abstracts
the latter by allowing callers to pass in custom SocketFactory
objects, but does not yet abstract the former.

This change takes the existing internal Dns interface, which is
currently used for testing, and turns it into a publicly
accessible HostResolver interface. This allows callers to
completely abstract all network interaction points.

Examples of what this can be used for:

1. Use alternative DNS implementations with different
   performance / caching / ordering / parallelization / ...
   characteristics than standard InetAddress.getAllByName.
2. Resolve hosts using different DNS servers than the system
   resolvers, or even non-DNS protocols (e.g., MDNS or even
   NetBIOS/WINS) that are not supported by the system resolver.
3. Do DNS lookups on specific networks, similarly to what
   android_getaddrinfofornet does.

Fixed the missing link by adding a new setFollowRedirects method to the

Each peer has a window size. The peer's window size controls how much
data we can send the peer, and our window size controls how much data
the peer can send us. We had these reversed in SpdyStream, so if the
peer specified a non-default window size we wouldn't send the required
WINDOW_UPDATE events when we needed to.

The connection has its own window size. But unlike the stream window
sizes, this needs to be manually adjusted with a windowUpdate frame
when the connection is opened.

Return HttpResponseCache to previous (e.g. KitKat) behavior",0.2,None,None

This change required to handle this Android scenario:

When this version of OkHttp is packaged into Android in a future
release (in com.android.okhttp...) there is a possibility that
an older version of OkHttp bundled with application
(in com.squareup.okhttp...) will pick up the newer HttpResponseCache
via ResponseCache.getDefault(). It will attempt to use the get() / put()
methods. Commit e2599be9e073f1be8e929597c358e2664ab0c9a9 was
intended to restore HttpResponseCache get() and put() and avoid the
UnsupportedOperationException that would be thrown.

Unfortunately, it didn't quite do it:

In KitKat and older versions OkHttp, in HttpResponseCache the behavior
was to ignore any calls to put(URI, URLConnection) including
any HttpURLConnection/HttpsURLConnection that wasn't its own
(i.e. only ones from com.android.okhttp would be cached). The previous
fix to HttpResponseCache re-introduced get()/put() but didn't implement
the necessary instanceof checks.

Jesse also informs me that coexistance with other implementations
of HttpURLConnection is not required (since OkHttp replaces the
HTTP implementation on the desktop). I have also since discovered
that HttpResponseCache didn't implement the cache-control logic
required to follow the letter of the Java API anyway, which means
that HttpResponseCache is not suitable for use in cases where
the Http(s)URLConnection implementation expects a fully compliant
implementation.

I'm unhappy with java.io:
 * No timeouts.
 * Every layer needs to copy bytes around. Always copying bytes.
 * Features like mark/reset and available() are clumsy.
 * Its awkard in mixed text/binary protocols like HTTP because
   character decoding is separate and takes over the stream.

Unfortunately java.nio isn't better, just different:
 * It's complex.
 * Buffers are fixed size.
 * No built-in buffer pooling.
 * Features like mark/reset/position are clumsy.

inspired by InputStream and OutputStream, but using growable

This change is a combination of 4 separate commits
to fix various bugs observed during android platform
testing.

https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/63781/
--------------------------------------------
Allow certificate inspections after connect.

We don't have to wait for the request to be sent
before allowing inspection of SSL certs. They can be
inspected as soon as the connection is established.

Fixes CTS test UrlConnectionTest#testInspectSslAfterConnect

https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/63821/
---------------------------------------------
Respect read timeout on recycled connections.

Partial fix for CTS test : URLConnectionTest#testGetKeepAlive.

https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/63782/
-----------------------------------
Fix HttpUrlConnection#isUsingProxy.

The earlier implementation disregarded what the
ProxySelector had to say. We now query the selected
route (if one has been established).

Fixes compatibility test:
HttpURLConnectionTest#testUsingProxySelector

https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/63872/
--------------------------------------------
Don't support anything other than Basic auth.

We should disregard authentication schemes other than
""Basic"" and let clients handle them themselves.

The java Authenticator API gives us a user name and
password combination, but we can't know how to format
that information for any scheme other than basic.

Historically:

The JB implementation responds to challenges from an
arbitrary scheme ""X"" by sending a header with scheme
""X"" but formatted like the ""Basic"" scheme.

The current implementation responds to challenges from
an arbitrary scheme ""X"" by sending a header with scheme
""Basic"" and formatter like the ""Basic scheme"".

Partial fix for test cases in URLConnectionTest:
- testAuthenticateWithCommaSeparatedAuthenticationMethods
- testAuthenticateWithMultipleAuthenticationHeaders",0.7,None,None

we can do hostname verification on the desktop, which wasn't possible

Writing this change has led me to believe that the
concurrency here is just plain awful, and I need to
find a better solution than what I have. In particular,
there are too many threads:
 - the internal reader thread
 - application reader threads
 - application writer threads
And too many locks:
 - the SpdyWriter I/O write lock
 - the SpdyConnection internal state lock
 - each SpdyStream's internal state lock

What's currently very wrong is the internal reader thread
is updating state in the SpdyStream, and reading bytes from
the network into a particular stream. It is an error to hold
the SpdyStream's lock while reading, but we're doing it because
we need to hold the state on the buffer, position and limit.
We need to rethink this!

forget' events. We can't do that because SPDY writes need to
throw IOExceptions if the writes fail.",0.7,None,None

The HTTPS tests time out due to a bug in Froyo that prevents
its TLS library from working as a server. I manually verified
that TLS works as a client without problem.

I also tested this on Gingerbread. It passes all tests except
for testConnectViaHttpProxyToHttpsUsingProxySystemProperty, which

Bug 6294000

MockWebServer passes null as the requestLine argument to
RecordedRequest sometimes which causes a NPE. Fix
RecordedRequest's constructor to allow for null method
and path which is parsed from the requestLine argument.

AOSP author: Jeff Sharkey
Date: Thu Mar 29 14:04:11 2012 -0700

Add setHeader() and removeHeader() that mutate matching MockResponse
headers. Support ""bytes-per-second"" to throttle response rate. Split
request line into components.

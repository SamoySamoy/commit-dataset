Summary:
When upgrading to AndroidX Activity/Fragment 1.5.1, if FB4A is not installed then the backup CCT flow will break.

The following video is HB4A using Android Acitivty/Fragment 1.5.1 and reproducing the CCT problem. Note that nothing can be clicked on after the login flow is complete. Then clicking the back button says no permissions were granted.
https://pxl.cl/2bHRd

The root cause of the issue is that there were internal changes for the 1.5.1 update and using startActivityForResult does not trigger onActivityResult correctly. This seems to only happen when you try to start an activity when it doesn't exist.

In NativeAppLoginMethodHandler, we can't tell if FB4A is installed so we just attempt to start the activity and catch the ActivityNotFoundException if it does not start. If the native flow cannot be attempted, then we fallback to CCT flow. For some reason, after failing to start the FB4A intent, the LoginFragment does not correctly trigger the onActivityResult function when the backup CCT flow completes. The error also seems to occur if you click cancel on the CCT flow.

This diff updates the LoginFragment to have a new ActivityLauncher member and updates NativeAppLoginMethodHandler to use the launcher to launch the FB4A intent. We also now query for the intent instead of try/catch the start attempt. It seems this is the primary issue.

In 1.4.0 and below, if an activity cannot be started, it will still trigger the on result flow.
In 1.5.0 and above, if an activity cannot be started, it will not trigger the on result flow.

ModelManager would benefit from some significant refactoring to make business logic more individually testable, e.g. by moving model caching logic  into its own class or methods.

Some of the conventions for these unit tests were copied from other test files, e.g. LoginManagerTest.

Modifies the code in AlohaDeviceAuthDialog.java related to animating the QR code when it is clicked on on Catalina to animate it and make it larger. There is an issue where if users hit the back button while the QR code is expanded, instead of returning to the regular split QR view the flow will navigate to the previous screen instead.

(note the user can also dismiss the QR view by clicking the center dpad button again.)

This fix also involved a slight change to DeviceAuthDialog.kt to allow for suppressing the regular back button functionality.

Basically we can use the new API by
```
val launcher = registerForActivityResult(
  loginManager.createLogInActivityResultContract(callbackManager)) {...}

launcher.launch(permissions)
```
Or in Java
```
ActivityResultLauncher<Collection<String>> launcher =

727,Mengxiao Lin,mxlin@fb.com,"""Extract construction of InternalAppEventsLogger

Summary:
TL;DR: in order to get accurate test coverage data, we need to avoid `PowerMockito.whenNew` to mock the construction of an object. This diff replaced the constructions of InternalAppEventsLogger with new factory methods.

PowerMockito is **not compatible** with Jacoco, the tool for obtaining test coverage.

The root cause is that PowerMockito will do bytecode level operations to replace the class to be mocked. Generally it's fine because we don't treat the replaced code as part of the ""covered code"". The problem is how PowerMockito implement `whenNew`. It will manipulate the classes who create the objects, rather than the classes whose objects are created.

For example, we have a class A. It creates an object of class B with B's constructors. We wish to mock the class B. What we need to declare in `PrepareForTest(...)` is A rather than B. The class A will be modified during the runtime.

`InternalAppEventsLogger` is the common class B in our codebase. A lot of classes create a logger instance to implicitly send the log to AppEvents. In order to test the logging behaviors, we have to mock `InternalAppEventsLogger`, which in fact modifies the classes being tested in the runtime. This procedure blocks Jacoco to get correct test coverage data.

By adding a factory function, we can simply mock the companion object of `InternalAppEventsLogger` and return a mock logger during the tests.

Another approach is to do real dependency injection like what we do for iOS: adding a `InternalAppEventsLoggerProvider` to do all these stuffs. It's something we may need to do if we move AppEvents out of the core kit. Since code coverage will be an important metric for our team in the next half, I would like to fix it with an easy approach and do BE stuffs during the lightweight SDKs project is executed.

One reason I hesitate to do real dependency injection in Android SDK is because unlike iOS where we can control whether to include a method (declaration) in the binary with C macros, any setters will be kept in the binary code. There's no any forms of conditional compilation in the whole Java/JVM/Android ecosystems... The result is that we will have a huge bunch of setters merely for testing remaining in the generated bytecode. The tradeoff between testability and binary size is hard.

899,Mengxiao Lin,mxlin@fb.com,"""Support AndroidX activity result APIs on Login

Summary:
As title. The principle idea is to automatically use androidx activity result APIs if they're available and call facebook CalbackManager when the result is returned.

Now `LoginButton` will check its context to find whether the context support AndroidX activity result APIs (by `ActivityResultRegistryOwner`). Then it will launch the intent through AndroidX activity result APIs and forward the result to `CallbackManager` inside our SDK. Apps that uses AndroidX activity >=v1.2 or fragment >=v1.3 no longer need to override `onActivityResult` to handle the callback.

Changes:
1. New methods are added to `LoginManager` to support androidx activity result APIs and avoid overriding `onActivityResult()` method.
2. LoginButton will memorize the `CallbackManager`, which will be used to handle activity result.

There could be times when developers don't receive anything for `user_friend`, and/or other fields (If they didn't request them). We need to make sure we keep it as `null` instead of empty field or empty list. As these two can have different meanings

null - means the permission didn't requested
empty - means the permission did requested, but the actual field is empty. (e.g null `user_friend` list vs empty `user_friend` list

# Facebook:

This diff adds parceling test for AuthenticationHeader

 ---

## End Goal (See below)

Problem -
Currently the create from parcel method on root level `AuthenticationToken` relies on creating the whole token from expected nonce. This actually tries to verify claims+signature again, which does another HTTP round trip to get Public Key to validate signature. This is not ideal, we would want to organically re-construct the AuthenticationToken from parcel without validating the signature again.

Solution -
Make sure Header and claims parceling works, then when we do a writeToParcel, we can just do `writeParcel` instead of `writeString`

We need to send deviceName to the backend, which can send it to along with notification. We display the deviceName to user when they tap on the notification. Since I couldn't find a good way to retrieve the display name on server side itself, passing it from client.

Created a package visible method `addExtraDeviceInfo` which will be overriden by Portal sdk `AlohaDeviceAuthDialog` which has same package name `com.facebook.login`. So `AlohaDeviceAuthDialog` should be able to override this method and provide extra info i.e. device name to it.

Facebook Android SDK maintains to be compatible with minSDK >= 15. Hence for now we can only keep jvmTarget to 1.6 to have the same behaviors as the old Kotlin compilers and avoid changes in developer's side.

Summary:
Due to the visibility problem in kotlin, we expose a lot of internal classes/methods to allow unit tests to access them. By moving the tests related to an internal class to the kit's own test package, we can add the `internal` modifer back to protect the visibility.

It's harder than we thought before. Many tests classes are coupled together. In order to verify that we are ready for doing this refactor, I do an experiment with `AppEventStore` and fix the configuration for building/executing the tests inside the CoreKit.

Summary:
`AutomaticAnalyticsLoggerTest` has a strange behavior: when the test class is run as a whole, the tests pass. However, if some of its test cases run independently, the tests fail. It's caused because the test tries to verify whether `InternalAppEventsLogger` is created during logging. However, at the initialization of `AutomaticAnalyticsLogger` an instance of `InternalAppEventsLogger` will be created.

This diff fixes the bug by verifying the actual logging behavior rather than object creation.

Summary:
As title. `GraphRequest` is one of the most important class in the SDK and this diff unavoidably changed the external interfaces. I try my best to minimize the changes and for Java code nothing need to be changed. But there still some differences in Kotlin side.

1. `Callback.onComplete()` will have a nonnull parameter.For Kotlin side, if the client code implements it with nullable parameters, it will be treated as different function. It can be fixed with very little effort.
2. `GraphJSONArrayCallback` and `GraphJSONObjectCallback` will have a nullable parameter following the documents. For Kotlin side if the client code implement it with nonnull parameter, it will be treated as different function. It will force the client to do null check on the parameters.

Also updated the tests that require mocking static methods of GraphRequest.

`GraphRequest` in ushba is also migrated to Kotlin, otherwise many tests that needs to mock behaviors of GraphRequest will fail.

When `GraphRequest.java` is in Java, public version and ushba version have following differences:
1. [ushba add] a new private field named `graphDomainOverride`
2. [ushba add] getter/setter for a public field name `graphDomainForSingleRequest`. This field is computed based on `graphDomainOverride`
3. [ushba add] new private methods `getAccessTokenToUseForRequest`, `getClientTokenForRequest`, `getUrlWithGraphPath`, `isValidGraphRequestForDomain`, `shouldForceClientTokenForRequest`, `isApplicationRequest`
4. [ushba modify] implementation of private method `addCommonParameters`

So all added fields/methods are translated to Kotlin in this diff. I also follow the ushba's `addCommonParameters` to write the Kotlin version of it.

The most notable difference is that the basic remove method `remove(index: int)` is renamed to `removeAt(index: int)`, and other remove methods use the new basic remove method to do the deletion. However, the interface in Java remains unchanged. Hence I only override the new `removeAt` method.

Finally, all parameters are declared as non-null following their semantics and usages in our codebase.

1257,Mengxiao Lin,mxlin@fb.com,"""Migrate AccessToken into Kotlin

Summary:
As title. `AccessToken` is an important and foundational class in the SDK, hence I try my best to keep the API unchanged. However, we still have very small differences in the behaviors. I believe these differences won't lead to a change in client codes (in fact, we only make client code easier). Here are the differences:
1. `token`, `applicationId`, `userId` and `permissions` fields are promised to be nonnull. The reason is that according to its constructor, these properties must be nonnull if it's properly constructed.
2. The validations on `token`, `applicationId` and `userId` are also enforced when the users call `CREATOR.createFromParcel()`. Now if the source parcel object is invalid, there will be an exception rather than returning an invalid `AccessToken` object. It's reasonable because `createFromParcel()` assumes the parameter is correct and valid.

There is still a problem needs to be done: an interface for callback has terrible function naming. We can only fix it in a major release so I keep it unchanged.

Also, we have some static getters and I keep them rather than using static fields. If we use static fields, the interface to Java is unchanged, but the interface to Kotlin will be changed. It's interesting that Kotlin will only treat getter/setters on objects as fields when import Java code.

There was only one test I wasn't able to re-enable and that's `ExceptionAnalyzerTest` because it relies on `!BuildConfig.DEBUG`.

Summary:
Justification for the original task below.

# Future.cancel(true) considered harmful

The Future.cancel API takes a boolean indicating whether to interrupt the task if it's currently running. Please pass false only.

## DETAILS
Future.cancel(true) will interrupt the thread upon which the task is running. This is only safe to do if you can guarantee that all the code running within your task handles interrupts gracefully. If your code is running in FB4A (and probably other apps too, but I haven't checked), then you can't guarantee this. You may cause code running outside of your task, in a different thread, to fail mysteriously.In fact, any use of Thread.interrupt (other than invoking it on the current thread) can cause the same problem.

This logview trace is an example of what happens when a thread is interrupted and it's not handled gracefully. You can look into logcat and see more details. Here's a symbolicated view: P130429284

We use FileChannel when loading classes. FileChannel will throw ClosedByInterruptException if it's running within a thread that is interrupted. I'm going to catch/handle this one particular problem, but I'm not confident there aren't others.
Exceptions that result from attempts to load classes will be saved and re-thrown the next time the same class load is attempted. Which may be on a different thread. See [http://androidxref.com/.../art/runtime/class_linker.cc...](http://androidxref.com/9.0.0_r3/xref/art/runtime/class_linker.cc#208)

The ExecutorService API will normally ignore Throwables (unless afterExecute is overridden). This is potentially worse than a crash, since if a particular class is only used within an ExecutorService task, the resulting NoClassDefFoundError may never be detected. Instead the app will just silently fail to run such tasks. In the case of the pasted trace, the problem is initially ignored when it happens within the SocialWifiDetector$1 Runnable (which is run within a FutureTask), but is then detected when the same class load is attempted within TigonObservableRunnable (which is not within a FutureTask).

## Follow-ups:
T66631068 - Fix known causes of interrupts during classloading causing failures
T66631113 - Lint on usage of Future.cancel(true)
T66631161 - Replace usages of Future.cancel(true) with Future.cancel(false)
T66631218 - Soft error upon afterExecute if the Throwable is an Error

1380,Maxim Goretskyy,maximg@fb.com,"""Removes two deadlocks

Summary:
almost tl;dr
FacebookSDK.java has a lot synchronized methods,
when it calls statically class A or class B, they call methods from FacebookSDK themselves, but the lock on those methods is acquired already because it is synchronized on class lock.
This is a ticking bomb. Right now it worked because we call things in a very specific order and call it in Executor first time.
Hence the solution is to
1) remove class lock and have variable lock on initialized. This should be safe because we just change what we lock on.

2) remove dependency on another synchronized method since it is not needed. This should be safe as the SDK should already be initialized to get applicationID. This is either done in ContentProvider automatically, or will be done in your Application/Main-activity as recommended in the docs. If there are concerns, we can always add same method unsynchronized to only be used inside AppEventsLogger since the possible deadlock can arise from there.

Summary:
We want to make sure `AutoHandleExceptions` annotations also work with Kotlin to make sure migration is smooth and does not have much changes in behaviour.

`apply-plugin` is needed in order for kotlin-tasks in gradle to exist, so we can use them in `safekit-build.gradle` when we try to get `kotlinProvider`. This is because the safekit-build is in the root and applies to all plugins. _Maybe_ it is possible to refactor the existing stuff and copypaste the same config everywhere, but I do not think it is worth the time.

The addition in InjKit is similar to invoke-method without class-loading stuff. I am not sure why it is needed, it will recursively call itself after, I tried to go back in history and I suspect it couldve been some bug in gradle. Not having it works as well. I also did not want to ruthlessly refactor it since I do not know how many might use it as it is, and easier to add a new method that does almost same things and imo it is still clean.

KotlinTask does not call getBootstrapPath, reason for that is I have not been able to find a method like it when I used reflection. To repro:

```
//    System.out.println(""task clazz "" + compileTask.getClass());
//    Method[] declaredMethods = compileTask.getClass().getDeclaredMethods();

//    for (Method m : declaredMethods) {
//      System.out.println(m.toString());
//    }
//    System.out.println(compileTask.getClass().getDeclaredMethods());
//    System.out.println(""XXXXX"");
//    Object getKotlinOptions = invokeGetter(compileTask, ""getKotlinOptions"");
//    Method[] declaredMethods1 = getKotlinOptions.getClass().getDeclaredMethods();
//    for (Method m : declaredMethods1) {
//      System.out.println(m.toString());
//    }
```

Summary:
See task
We are already running github actions, ran in parallel to make sure no issues. Now time to kill travis.
As far as release goes, the person releasing would need to manually check it is passing (as before), alternatively we could look into githubs API what they have, but this is out of scope of this diff. Additionally, the right solution is to release from github actions directly, but we cannot do that due InjKit.

Manually fixed some failing tests.
For broadcastreceiveir it tries to mock constructor of an abstract class, so refactored a work around to mock it instead of spying.
AssertEquals only has 2 args in that version.
AssertThrows does not exist, either we need to use expected-annotation or the workround I created, can later refactor it out so other classes can use it too.

Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk/pull/849

The failure can not repro locally, I just narrowed the cause area down to the mock of the static function checkCodelessSession. For some reason it doesn't work on Travis CI. The reason of mocking this is to verify it has been called under some test cases, since Robolectric4 stop supporting verify a particular static function has been called.

Summary:

For Custom tab details for Android 11, see this guide: https://developers.google.com/web/android/custom-tabs/implementation-guide#how_can_i_check_whether_the_android_device_has_a_browser_that_supports_custom_tab

Notice that the app needs to add the intent to the queries element.

This diff changes the way FB Login on Android handles Custom Tabs. Instead of initially querying for the package and only trying to open Custom tabs if it does succeed, now this will attempt to open and catch ActivityNotFoundException if it does not succeed. It then falls back to the next handler in that case.

The functionality changes a bit when building with 30. It defaults to choosing the user's preferred browser. Originally, it would pick the first intent it finds, which may not be the user's preferred browser.

Summary:
As SEV follow up, we want to make sure that wrong server-side data doesn't cause SDK initialization to break.

I'm introducing new test helper class that takes JSON string and tries to replace any key with random type. SDK should never break for all of this inputs.

Due to my lack of knowledge on Android testing or/and old testing frameworks, I had to come up with pretty awful code.
- Robolectric 3 explodes when JSON(or just Object) types are being passed. Migrating to Robolectric 4 is different big thing.
- JSON package is unmocked and not allowed to be called in preparation methods, forcing me to write yet another awful code. I'm truly sorry.

But in the end it works, it generates ~100 tests with different variations of input JSON.

Added Monitor class
Monitor class is the entry point of the Monitoring System.
The usage of the Monitoring System will be:
```
// assign value of timeStart, timeSpent or the value want to be logged
LogEvent logEvent = new LogEvent(""FB_CORE_STARTUP"", LogCategory.PERFORMANCE);
MonitorLog log = new MonitorLog.LogBuilder(logEvent)
                .timeStart(timeStart)
                .timeSpent(timeSpent)
                .build();
Monitor.add(log);
```
Monitor needs to be enabled before using it to add log. Enable Monitor will fetch the sampling rates from FB server, send the logs in the disk and clean the disk. *Enable part will be added in the next diff.*

**Sampling rate** is an integer indicating that we will send one every x logs for a specific event name. We have a default sampling rate for all events which are not specified in the list.

2. Let's try to pre-load CCT request when SDK is building it. We can't do it before request being built, because we provide CCT and other parameters, it changes URI.

Potentially, we could prepare CCT request while we're trying other method with higher priority(app switch, for example), saving more time. Maybe for future improvement.

Summary:
Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk/pull/749

Since we added category attribute, and decided to track unique application id which is the package name for Android, I added these new fields in `MonitorLog` class.

`MonitorLog` has a required attribute `LogEvent` which contains event name and category. If the category is `PERFORMANCE`, the event name should be one of the values in `validPerformanceEventNames` Set.

Also, I removed `MonitorEvent`, because we want to track the usage of method in the future. The method name will be stored under event name field, using pattern className::methodName. We can't make the `MonitorEvent` as an Enum any more.

What actually happened? Can you provide a stack trace?
If the Facebook app is not installed, then on click of Facebook login button in App, by default WebView is opening instead of Custom Chrome Tab even I have enabled the Custom Tab for my project.

## Steps to Reproduce
What are the steps necessary to reproduce this issue?
Integrate Facebook Login Button in App
Uninstall Facebook App from the Device
Make sure your project is migrated to AndroidX.
Click on the ""Login With Facebook"" button, WebView is opening instead of Custom Chrome Tab

Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk/pull/670

Test Plan:
Built Hackbook with Gradle and buck and chrome custom tabs works for both
Buck: buck install hb4a. This uses Android X and is not working without this fix
Gradle: On Android studio

Went to Login > Login with custom tab to test the feature

There are a few reasons:

2) We want to understand how useful the sample apps are.

This requires the devs to follow the getting-started guide.

Bypasses alert if you change the string to anything else, but giving a non-valid appid will not make it work correctly.

Summary:
The idea is that API will be used internally to measure different possible startup metrics starting with cold start.

Note that TAG does not necessarily have to be 1:1 mapping to an SDK folder. The idea is that the TAG can describe your use-case. Since this will be internal API we have freedom to change/refactor naming of the tags if the needs arise.

The usage would be (after TAG enum is moved to its own file).

```
MetricsUtil.getInstance(applicationContext).startMeasureFor(FACEBOOK_CORE_STARTUP);
//your code
MetricsUtil.getInstance(applicationContext).stopMeasureFor(FACEBOOK_CORE_STARTUP);
```
AppEventsLoggerImpl can later poll this data with
```
MetricsUtil.getInstance(applicationContext).getLastTimeDifferenceFor(FACEBOOK_CORE_STARTUP);
```

Even if we decide to directly send it to the server, we would need a service that checks that SDK is fully initialized and then sends it separately. We would still need to store the data somewhere on device (sharedpreferences). I prefer AppEventsLoggerImpl approach because we need to map the startup time to some appid+device anyway which is handled by AppEvents already.

If adding new metrics to measure, it would be about adding new HashMap<Tag, YOUR_METRIC> and a new base string for that metric. The start/stop measure would collect all metrics, and then it will be up to the user  to query for the data they want.

The goal is to make an easy to use API.
Are there some use-cases that will not be covered by this?
For example, the class is not really thread-safe but it also does not make sense to call startMeasure/endMeasure for same tag from different threads.

All kinds of feedback is appreciated.

A small nit-problem is since we are making an async call to retrieve the data, the first time we get the URL it might not be there in time so we will receive null. As explained in the comments it should not be a problem, as all subsequent calls will have it.

Summary:

Therefore, to make logger tests better and well designed, we test the implementation of AppEventsLoggerImpl and test whether AppEventsLogger and InternalAppEventsLogger call the corresponding logging function of  AppEventsLoggerImpl. Besides, We will also add unit tests for AppEventsLogger and InternalAppEventsLogger's specific functions.

There already is a bug report for this but it has not been worked on yet because it is stuck in ""need more info"" state:
https://developers.facebook.com/support/bugs/278547559523105/

Looks like this comes from invalid/unexpected values delivered by your codeless configuration JSON data.

What this change does
--
This change fixes the uncaught exceptions by catching them to avoid the resulting crashes. Imho this should be done anyway for incoming data processing and should have been done from the start of this feature.

What this change doesn't do
--
The unexpected values in the configuration data have to be handled somehow of course but this is out of the scope of this fix.

Misc
--
To whom it may concern: your pull request template seems to be out of date. It tells me to issue my pull request against your `:dev` branch but there is no such branch.

Summary:
Some scenarios involving batched Graph API calls are more cleanly implemented with a completion callback that applies
to the batch as a whole, rather than individual requests within the batch. This commit adds such a callback to
RequestBatch.

It also fixes a couple issues with Session and reauthorization. It adds a check to ensure that the access token resulting
from a reauthorization represents the same Facebook profile as the previous access token did (since users could authenticate
using different credentials than when the session was originally opened). It also fetches a current list of permissions
for the user following a reauthorization, to help ensure that the client copy of the permission list stays in sync with
the service.

Finally, it fixes LoginActivity to pass back the AccessTokenSource of the access token it provides, so we can set it properly.

Summary:
PickerFragment.loadData allowed the caller to specify that a reload should not be forced if data was already present, but
this did not take into account the case where a request had been issued but no response received. In the case of longer
queries, this could result in, e.g., frequent device rotations, constantly restarting the query (and forgetting about the
old one) and never receiving results. Fixed to take into account pending-but-not-finished requests, and also remember
activity circle state between activity restarts, so the activity circle properly reflects the current state.

Test Plan:
- Introduced artificially long delay in async requests (e.g., 10 seconds), repeatedly rotated device
- Observed that activity circle was correct and request completed in the expected time; without change, request
was constantly restarted and did not finish until device rotation ceased.

Summary:
Previously, a race condition existed in HelloFacebook where handlePendingActions could be called before all conditions
necessary to successfully call the pending action were in place. In particular, a cancelled permissions upgrade would
cause us to attempt to post a photo or status update anyway. Added a handler so that cancelling the permissions upgrade
will display an informative message and abort the attempt to post. Improved the pending action handlers so they will not
attempt an action if all necessary conditions are not met, but will instead stay in the pending state until they are
called again. (For instance, we may be called because this.user was filled in, while we are still waiting for a pending
permissions upgrade -- now, we'll recognize that we aren't ready to execute the pending action and will wait for the
permissions upgrade to complete.)

However, this is a summary of behavior at different API-lev

Summary:
To enable this, we attempt to use executeOnExecutor if it is available,
and call it with AsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR (or an Executor the app
specifies via Settings.setExecutor).

If that API is not available, we fall back to AsyncTask.execute.

Either way, for API-levels >=8 (which is what we support), we are
running Requests in parallel by default, and we provide a mechanism
for overriding this behavior whenever possible.

Test Plan:
- Unit tests
- Set a breakpoint for a test that exercises this and watch behavior
  for android-8 and android-16.

Test Plan:
- Ran HelloFacebook (without SSO), was able to upgrade permissions and status update was posted successfully
- Un-TOSed app and re-ran, app did not crash (this is still not completely desirable behavior, as we should check
for the un-TOS case and do something else, but it fixes the crash)

Summary:
Gingerbread introduced a new StrictMode which allows setting per-thread policies that can take various actions, up
to killing the process, if certain operations are performed on the thread. Honeycomb made the defaults stricter.
We should avoid performing any I/O operations on the UI thread, to ensure that apps using StrictMode do not encounter
any unexpected exceptions.

RequestAsyncTask will now perform request serialization on the background thread, rather than the calling thread. This
means any serialization errors will now have to be handled in the request callback rather than at the time the task
is created.

Friend/Place picker image downloading will now only hit the cache from a worker thread, not from the UI thread.

Unit tests will now turn StrictMode on for the UI thread, but leave it off for all other threads. A helper exists
to turn it on for any given thread if desired.

Summary:
The Facebook class's most full authorize() method takes a single
parameter that encodes both the request code to use for SSO and
login behavior.  There are two problems with this:
1) There is no way to specify SSO_ONLY
2) The semantics of the parameter is mixed

While it may not be possible to use -1 as a valid request code, (is
it?) it is better to have an API that does not convolute these two
concerns.

Although Facebook will be deprecated and we do not intend to add
features going forward, creating the Session via Facebook is the
mechanism by which apps can take a dependency on new functionality
incrementally.  To support this, we are adding an authorize()
overload here.

Summary:
This commit adds basic functionality around testing some of the new UI components (specifically, GraphObjectPagingLoader and
FriendPickerFragment). Testing is light at the moment, this serves mostly to get the infrastructure in place for further tests.

FacebookTestCase is split into a base class, FacebookActivityTestCase, which can be used on arbitrary Activity classes;
FacebookTestCase itself continues to use a trivial Activity that does nothing, and is appropriate for non-UI-centric tests.

FriendPickerFragmentTests shows how to use the new base class to test an activity containing a fragment. Future commits will
likely refactor this into a base class that can be used on arbitrary fragments, as we add more fragments.

Moved the support library out from individaul projects and added it as a project-level lib, to reflect the fact that it will be
used in multiple libs and samples.

Summary:
There was only a single method for setting the access token on the
Facebook class (setAccessToken()).  This did not distinguish between
setting a token loaded from cache vs.  setting a new token resulting
from authorization.

Since setAccessToken() updates the last-token-updated timestamp, and
since this timestamp is used to determine when to refresh the token,
it always looked like the token had just been updated when the app's
Activity started.  This meant the Facebook class would never try to
refresh the token.

To fix this, the Facebook class now supports getting the value of the
last-token-updated timestamp, and also supports restoring this along
with the token value and expiration timestamp in a single operation.

This also updates Hackbook to demonstrate caching.

Summary:
This commit adds a TestSession class, which serves much the same purpose as the FBTestSession class in
the iOS SDK. It allows test accounts to be created in either a shared or private mode. In shared mode,
the permissions of the test account are encoded as part of its name, so future test cases can re-use
the same test account rather than create a new one. In private mode, a test account is created with the
necessary permissions and then deleted at the end of the session, to avoid proliferation of test accounts.
(The encoding of permissions is done using the String.hash method, which will be different than the encoding
used on iOS, so test accounts will not be shared between the two platforms at the moment, and there is a very
small possibility of hash code collisions that could result in permissions-related errors. The possibility is
pretty remote.)

Added a FacebookTestCase that simplifies use of TestSession by reading in applicationId and applicationSecret
from a config.json file that is created by the new configure_unit_tests.sh script, similar to what we did
for iOS.

TestBlocker provides message-pumping-and-waiting functionality similar to FBTestBlocker. Given the synchronous
nature of calls on Android, TestBlocker will not be needed as frequently as on iOS, but it is needed to test
session authorization, which happens asynchronously, as well as obviously any asynchronous-specific test cases.

Made necessary changes to some classes (AccessToken, Session) to make certain members have default visibility
rather than private, in order to let TestSession override functionality it needed to. Session can now take a
handler passed in from outside rather than using its own, which is necessary to correctly pump messages through
the TestBlocker's handler in test cases.

Fixed up some code in Response that was incorrectly handling Facebook returning naked 'true' or 'false' responses.

non-batched) requests is functional, with many caveats. There is no (de-)serialization of GraphObjects as of yet, so most
requests to Graph API will not result in a Response that is useful for anything (though the debugger can be used to
verify that JSONObjects in the right shape are being created). There is no support for requests that return JSONArrays
rather than JSONObjects. There are a million ""TODO port:"" comments indicating where functional parity with iOS is still
lacking.

This commit adds some functionality around creating Requests, setting properties, and beginning to handle

Summary:
Logging was turned on unconditionally before, which led to apps leaking

developers have to turn on.

It's unfortunate that this isn't automatic - ideally this would automatically
turn on for non-release signed bits.  I couldn't find such a check in Android
framework.  If android experts have better ways of tackling this, i'm all ears.
But bear in mind this is a security fix and needs to go out asap.

 - ones that have some expiration period( (expiresIn > 0)
When we receive a new token from FB server for both them we call the

Because of that:
1. We shouldn't ignore the ""0"" value
2. We should also expect tokens that have long expiration period.
For example 60 days is 2592000000000 miliseconds which is too much for an
integer variable to handle :)

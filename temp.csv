This PR unifies `Major` to `MAJOR` to follow SemVer convention better, with `verb` corrected to `noun` (I'm treating this as a typo since the de facto standard is noun, so no new version is added with all old docs modified). Translations are also corrected (I can't read them, done with Google translation), except that Polish itself has used `noun` instead of `verb`.

This disables `git log` showing signatures (`--no-show-signature`)
unless `showSignature` is set to a truthy value.  This way differences
in developers` local configuration (`log.showSignature`) do not affect
tooling operation.  Callers of `gitRawCommits` will need to explicitly
request signatures (via `rawGitOpts`) if they are desired, instead of
the current behavior of the presence of signatures being undefined.

Recommended version bump detection with ESLint preset is broken since
`conventional-changelog-eslint` version 3.0.0:

`npx conventional-recommended-bump -p eslint` always returns ""patch"".

This is because the preset's `parserOpts` (re-used with v3.0.0)
""headerCorrespondence"" is set to `['tag', 'message']` rather than
`['type', 'subject']`, which was used before in the [ESLint preset
""conventional-recommended-bump"" specific `parserOpts`][1].

This adapts the ESLint preset's `whatBump` implementation to check ""tag""
instead of ""type"", which fixes the issue.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Re-use parser options object between components of a preset. For some

Closes #186.

version number header that constitutes the changelog header. This means
that consumers of rendered markdown will not be able to use a URL that
has been constructed to contain a version number anchor tag reference,
since the anchor tag won't exist in the rendered markdown.

It's stronly recomended consumers use the full URL path to the release
page for a given version, as that URL is a permalink to that verison,
contains all relavent release information, and does not, otherwise, rely
on the anchor tag being excessible from the current page view.

The issue is that our Node 4 build uses npm version 2, which symlinks
all dependencies directly in the node_modules/ folder under
`conventional-changelog` (Instead of relying on hoisted packages
supported by newer versions of npm). When the tests execute, they
attempt to require the angular preset, which returns `undefined`
because Node 4 can't resolve symlink'd paths.

Therefore the solution, I believe, is to update our build to use npm
version 3 in our Node 4 build.

Not great, because npm version 2 is the default for Node 4
installations, but unfortunately our current mono-repository setup
doesn't work in such a way to make testing npm version 2 possible.""",0,changed

1714,"""feat: support `conventional-changelog-*` presets in `conventional-recommended-bump` (#270)

Add support to pass in a `conventional-changelog-*` preset package
name through a `preset` option in the options argument passed to
`conventional-recommended-bump`.

Previous behavior of the `preset` option was to map the name provided
through the option to one of the presets built into this
`conventional-recommended-bump` package.

Now we take the name passed to the `preset` option, whether passed
programmatically or via the CLI, pass it to
`conventional-changelog-preset-loader`, and use the returned result as
the preset package.

The loading behavior matches the behavior of the `preset` option in
`conventional-changelog`. Including support for the different export
types of conventional preset packages, such as a promise, function,
or object.

Lastly, we defer to `recommendedBumpOpts.parserOpts` property of a preset
package if it exists, as our initial refactor efforts created a
`parserOpts` object under `recommendedBumpOpts` in each preset package.

In the future we will merge differences found in
`recommendedBumpOpts.parserOpts` into the top-level `parserOpts` object
of each `conventional-changelog-*` preset and remove
`recommendedBumpOpts.parserOpts` from each preset package, if it exists.

BREAKING CHANGES:

First:

Will only accept the name associated with a `conventional-changelog-*`
preset package for the purpose of loading preset configuration.

Built-in presets previously available in `conventional-recommended-bump`
are no longer available.

The preset package name can be any value supported by
[`conventional-changelog-preset-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-preset-loader).

Related to #241

Second:

Remove backwards-compatible support for `whatBump` to return a number.

If `whatBump` returns a number it will no longer be mapped to an object
with a `level` and `releaseType` property. Please update the passed in
`whatBump` function to return an object with a `level` property
indicating the type of bump (`0` for `major, `1` for `minor`, and `2`
for `patch`).

Third:

A callback function must be provided to `conventional-recommended-bump`,
either in the second argument spot, in place of `parserOpts`, or in the
third argument spot, technically reserved for a callback.""",0,added

3392,"""feat(commit)!: pass footer token and separator to template (#97)

* fix(commit): pass footer token and separator to template

Currently, when a conventional commit has footers, only the footers'
values (the part after the separator token, such as `:`) are passed to
the template. This means that when multiple footers, such as
`Signed-off-by:` and `Co-authored-by:` are present, it isn't currently
possible for the template to determine the name of the footer. This
makes actually using data from footers in templates impractical in most
cases.

This commit fixes this by changing the `Serialize` impl for `Commit` to
pass the commit's footers as a structured object rather than a string.
The structured `Footer` type includes the footer's token (which is what
`git_conventional` calls the name preceding the separator token), the
separator, and the value.

I didn't make the new `Footer` type and `Commit::footers` method public,
because it isn't strictly necessary to add them to the `git-cliff-core`
public API to fix this issue. However, we can make them public in a
follow-up PR if this is considered useful.

Fixes #96

BREAKING CHANGE:

This changes type of the `commit.footers` array exposed to templates.
Currently, when a template uses `commit.footers`, it can treat the
values as strings. After this change, the footer object will need to
have its fields unpacked in order to use them.

However, the impact of this breakage is probably not that severe, since
it's not really practical to use footers in templates with the current
system.

* refactor(changelog): sort commits by newest in CHANGELOG

Previously, cliff was sorting the commits by oldest first.
Like:

```
 - Support parsing the missing scopes with `default_scope` (#8)
 - Support generating a changelog scoped to a directory (#11)
```

As the PR numbers indicate, the first bullet point is definitely
older than the latter.

With this update, it will look like this:
```
 - Support generating a changelog scoped to a directory (#11)
 - Support parsing the missing scopes with `default_scope` (#8)
```

Signed-off-by: Taylan Dogan <git@taylandogan.info>

* refactor: add sorting flag

I don't expect any other sorting types will be added
so the logic consist of checking whether it is
`newest` or not.

One could argue with why wouldn't I make this a boolean.
My answer would be, in my opinion, it lose its meaning
because this is not something we want to enable or disable
but something that we want to decide which pattern
we want to use. So it is more like a semantic choice.

 ### Refactor Config Reading During `exec`

This removes the previous workarounds that were required due to tests
setting configs that were not available in the constructor of the
commands.

This also made the fix for https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/45881
easier since the config checks for workspaces can now all be made in the
command. The fix was to move the package.json detection to
`@npmcli/config` and use that boolean instead of setting
`location=project` which affected all commands such as `config set`
saving to the wrong location.

Some notable changes from this refactor include:
-  `execWorkspaces` no longer being passed the raw workspace filters and
   instead requiring `this.setWorkspaces()` to be called which was
   already being done in most commands
- `static workspaces = [true|false]` on all commands to indicate
  workspaces support. This is used in docs generation and whether to
  throw when `execWorkspaces` is called or not.

 ### Drop `fakeMockNpm` and refactor `mockNpm`

This refactor also drops `fakeMockNpm` in favor of `realMockNpm` (now
just `mockNpm`), and adds new features to `mockNpm`.

Some new features of `mockNpm`:

- sets all configs via argv so they are parsed before `npm.load()`. This
  is the most important change as it more closely resembles real usage.
- automatically resets `process.exitCode`
- automatically puts global `node_modules` in correct testdir based on platform
- more helpful error messages when used in unsupported ways
- ability to preload a command for execution
- sets `cwd` automatically to `prefix` and sets `globalPrefix` to the
  specified testdir

Note that this commit does not include the actual test changes, which
are included in the following commits for readability reasons.

 ### Linting

This also removes some of the one off linting rules that were set in the
past to reduce churn and fixes all remaining errors.""",0,fixed

This moves all the dependencies of the `docs/` workspace to dev deps. I
had originally moved them out of devDeps as part of #5309, but this
seems to go against the grain of other tooling. We would have to special
case both `audit` and `licensee` to run on a custom subset of our
dependency tree.

Maybe one day when all tools can be piped the output of an `npm query`
this will be possible. It would be nice if we could only audit
dependencies that are bundled as part of the CLI.

But for now it's easier to move these to devDeps and then reinstall only
the docs workspace after pruning during the publish step.""",0,changed

Goals of this rewrite:

- Better portability of scripts to anywhere we can run `node` and no
  reliance on `make` or other tools
- More code inside `scripts/` and less inside of CI workflows to allow
  for easier local testing
- Reuse the same scripts for similar workflows (eg `publish` and
  `smoke-publish`)

Future goals:

- Allow testing of `scripts`

Some highlights of the new scripts:

`scripts/create-node-pr.js`

- This now operates on cloned copy of the base repo that is pushed to
  our fork, so we no longer need to manually sync our fork.
- Uses the published registry tarball for as much of the PR as possible,
  falling back to including local files from source. This will enable
  for easier migration to eventually only using the tarball contents.

`scripts/publish.js`

- Replaces `make publish`
- Will publish all workspaces that need to be published, before
  publishing the CLI.
- Makes running tests an optional part of the script, since CI now runs
  the tests.
- Can optionally only pack the tarball, for use in CI to test installing
  the tarball.

`scripts/util.js`

- Shared utilities for spawning commands including helpers for `npm` and
  `gh`.
- Common interface for running, parsing args, logging, and debugging
  of scripts.""",0,added

4938,"""feat: output json formatted errors on stdout (#5716)

This also adds a new output method `outputBuffer()` which will buffer
all output until it is flushed in the exit handler. This allows the exit
handler to catch any errors and append them to the output when in json
mode. This was necessary to not introduce a regression in the case of
npm/cli#2150.

BREAKING CHANGE: `npm` now outputs some json errors on stdout.
Previously `npm` would output all json formatted errors on stderr,
making it difficult to parse as the stderr stream usually has logs
already written to it. In the future, `npm` will differentiate between
errors and crashes. Errors, such as `E404` and `ERESOLVE`, will be
handled and will continue to be output on stdout. In the case of a
crash, `npm` will log the error as usual but will not attempt to display
it as json, even in `--json` mode. Moving a case from the category of an
error to a crash will not be considered a breaking change. For more
information see npm/rfcs#482.

Many of our commands parse their args via
[npm-package-arg](https://npm.im/npm-package-arg), which is a good
standard way of parsing a ""package"" argument.  However the docs
surrounding these args are not very consistent.  This can lead to
confusion in commands such as `npm publish` where the behavior is
slightly different than in the past due to this.

This adds a new help command `npm help package-spec` that describes what
this argument is, and can be, and also updates all the commands that
interpret their args this with to refer to them as `<package-spec>`.  It
also adds a link to the new help page on their docs pages.""",0,added

In certain edge cases, the glob could find files that manNumberRegex wouldn't match.

A possible solution would be to try to bring the two closer, but since globs and regexes are different syntaxes, the two will never be exactly the same.
It's always asking for bugs; better to just handle the issue directly.

In addition, when npm is installed globally in a system directory, the
glob can find other manpages with similar names.
For instance ""install.1"", ""init.1"", etc. Preferring low-numbered

   package.json whose name matches the package you are uninstalling, the
   local package.json will be read and its publishConfig applied to your

 - dead code inside the `npm unpublish` path was removed.  There is no
   need to check if you are unpublishing the last version here, you're

This changeset fixes the problem by allowing the load of the actual tree

included were actually demonstrating the problem by having empty trees
as result, these are now also updated with the expected tree result.

Previously `npm update` was not respecting the `save` option, it
would be impossible for users to use `npm update` and automatically
update their `package.json` files.

This fixes it by adding extra steps on `Arborist.reify._saveIdealTree`
to read direct dependencies of any `package.json` and update them as
needed when reifying using the `update` and `save` options.

- Uses config.isDefault to set a different value for the `save` config
  for both the update and dedupe commands
- Tweaks arborist to make sure saveIdealTree preserves the behavior of
  skipping writing to package-lock.json on save=false for install while
  still writing the lockfile for `npm update` with its new default value
  of save=false.
- Updated and added some new tests on arborist to cover for these tweaks
- Added `npm update --save` smoke test on cli

This decouples the log file writing from the terminal logging. We now
open an append only file at the start of the process and stream logs to
it. We still only display the log file message in timing mode or if
there is an error, but the file is still written regardless.

All logging now goes through `proc-log` and this is the first step to
removing `npmlog`. For now `npmlog` is still used for the terminal
logging but with a shim in front of it to make it easier to test and
use in conjunction with `proc-log`. Ref: npm/statusboard#366

This also refactors many of the tests to always use an explicit
`t.testdir` for their cache since the file is opened on each `new Npm()`.
Tests are also refactored to use more of `MockNpm` with behavior to
add config items and load `npm` if necessary. A new fixture `mockGlobals`
was also added to make much of this more ergonomic. Ref: npm/statusboard#410

Fix: #3962

When created from a hidden lockfile, shrinkwrap was always setting the
lockfileVersion to 3. The shrinkwrap command also needed to be updated
to log the correct message based on the lockfileVersion config instead
of the static lockfileVersion.

With these fixes, it was possible to log a better message whenever we
are changing the lockfileVersion, either from a config or any existing
lockfile.

Lastly, the tests for shrinkwrap were completely refactored to use the
real npm and test all conceivable scenarios, as well as removing usage
of `util.promisify` in favor of `fs.promises` now that we've dropped
support for Node 10.

subdirectory.

It also removes the Proxy `npm.commands` object, in favor of an
`npm.cmd` and `npm.exec` function that breaks up the two things that
proxy was doing. Namely, getting to the attributes of a given command
(`npm.cmd` now does this), and actually running the command `npm.exec`
does this.

workspace, which were things that affected the final result.

This does change the main config value of `user-agent` but not the
flattened one.  We are not using the main config value anywhere (which
is correct).

This adds the `audit` config item to the usage output of `npm ci`, and

to better communicate that the flag is needed to turn that normally true
option OFF.

The description of `audit` was also updated to reflect that it runs on
many different npm commands, not just install.  Because this flag is
included in the usage of those commands it's best to let the assocation
happen there instead of trying to be comprehensive in the description
itself.

Furthermore, if the auditLevel WAS set, we were setting the exit code to

6189,"""fix(ls): show relative paths from root

Change the output in `npm ls` for symlink dependencies (including
workspaces) to show the relative path from the project root, rather than
the absolute path of the link target.

This makes the output much less noisy and more ergonomic when many
workspaces and link dependencies are in use, especially when paths are
long.

It is arguable that this output might be slightly misleading, since the
_actual_ workspace symlink from `${root}/node_modules/b` to
`${root}/packages/b` has a link value of `../packages/b`, not just
`packages/b`.  (Or on Windows, always the full absolute path, because
junctions.)  Thus, `npm ls b` will not show the same output as `ls -l
node_modules/b`.

However, `npm ls` shows the logical tree, not the physical tree, so
presenting the user with a path that they can use and interpret is more
important than presenting them with the strictly accurate details of
their filesystem.

This was working by coincidence in 7.7.6 and before, and broken in the 7.8.0

have a package.json in your CWD it would fail with an ENOENT trying to read it.

This fixes it for real, so that if you are asking for info from a git spec, it
goes ahead and looks for the `latest` tag (or whatever tag you have configured

this is the default behavior if no locale is specified, `LC_ALL=sk` is
set in the test environment.

This makes npm as installed by the Node.js Windows MSI installer behave
properly under WSL, Cygwin, MINGW Git Bash, and the internal MINGW Git
Bash when posix CLI utilities are exposed to the cmd.exe shell.

The test is not quite as comprehensive as I'd like.  It runs on the

commands, since presumably the command itself already did whatever it

For example, `npm test` runs a test script, usually outputting test
results.  Having npm then tell me that my tests failed with exit status
1 and print a debug log, is unnecessary and unwanted.

When the error encountered for these commands does not have a non-zero

The ""do you have auth configured"" only takes into consideration a hard-coded

in your npmrc, we would erroneously tell you that to add a token.

This uses the same method that the rest of the publish chain uses to determine
which registry it would be publishing to, then sees if you have auth for THAT registry.

Because that other function does a hard fallback to the npm registry, there is no more
need for the exception we throw if you do not have one configured.  Also, the npm cli
already defaults that config item, so you can't even set it to a falsey value if you
wanted""",0,added

Since we now are using pacote/tar in a way that will rely on the default
process umask setting, and we set file/directory modes explicitly
anyway, there's no need to have a default umask setting that calls
process.umask()

As this method is not worker-thread safe, and is deprecated, it's best
for us to stop using it.

While digging into #2300, I realized it would be a lot easier if we

Also, why not let `npm config get foo bar baz` return just the keys
specified?

Also updates the docs, including the statement that `npm config set foo`
with no value sets it to `true`, when as far as I can tell, that has
never been the case.

When a file named 'npmrc' is in the root of the npm module that is
currently running, it adds config values that override the defaults (but
not the global or user configs).

This is a way for a system package installer to tell the npm that it
installs to put its globals somewhere other than the default.  In order
to keep these configs around when users self-update npm with `npm i -g
npm`, these config values must be ""sticky"", and ride along into the
newly globally installed npm.

This commit restores this behavior, fixing self-updating npm for Windows
users, and any other systems that may make use of this functionality.

This adds a flatOptions.flatten() method, which takes an object full of

an object that already inherits from npm's defaults, and is thus
expected to be internal only.

This commit also removes some config keys which were used by npm
dependencies at the start of the v7 beta process, but are no longer:

- all lockfile configs (since we don't use lockfiles any more! for
  anything! and good riddance, they're a rats' nest of race conditions)
- cacheMax/cacheMin (we only use preferOffline/offline/online now, so
  these are strictly legacy support as input and never shared with deps)

Once this lands in cli, we can remove the publishConfig handling logic
in npm-registry-fetch, as it will be redundant.""",0,changed

This commit fixes a problem in which npm outdated was breaking when
trying to read an invalid semver range spec defined for a given
installed dep by performing the `npm-package-arg` parsing within a
try/catch block instead of expecting to read properties from the
returned instance.

Also, adds the missing test for that specific line of code.

We are targetting 100% test coverage for npm v7 GA.  Using a
coverage-map, we require that any of the newly created tests fully cover
the module that they are testing.  However, this has the side effect of
_always_ hitting 100% coverage when running 'npm test', even though not
all modules are being tested.

This adds a new 'load-all' test which, in 'check-coverage' mode, tells
nyc to include every file in the project.

This also removes the double-run of our tests in CI, where we run once
and then immediately run the same exact thing again for Coveralls, and
sends the 'check-coverage' output to Coveralls instead.

7107,"""new npm-specific update-notifier implementation

This drops our usage of the update-notifier module, in favor of checking
ourselves, using the modules and UX patterns that npm already has in
place.

- While on a prerelease version, updates are checked for every day,
  instead of every week, and always checks for a new beta in the current
  release family.  Ie, ^7.0.0-beta.2 instead of latest.
- Latest version is suggested if newer than current.
- If current version is newer than latest, then we check again for an
  update in the current version family.  Ie, ^7.0.0 instead of latest,
  if current is 7.0.0 and latest is 6.x.
- Output is printed using log.notice, at the end of all other log
  output, so that it's both less visually disruptive, and less likely to
  be missed among other warnings and notices.

This has the side effect of requiring that we set npm.flatOptions as
soon as config is loaded, rather than waiting for a command to be run.
Since the cli runs a command immediately after loading anyway, this is
not a relevant change for our purposes, but worth mentioning here.""",0,added

I used the verbose form for ""."", because node v13.0 and v13.1 require
the string fallback, and if you ever want to add an ESM wrapper, this
will make it trivial to add the ""import"" key to the object form

The `tap` package bundles `import-jsx`, which in turn bundles
`@babel/core` and a bunch of other stuff.

However, even though `@babel/core` is in the bundle, it's getting placed
in the tree at the root.  This is a mistake.

Because the node is placed, and not given the `extraneous` flag, in the
ideal tree building process, when reified, it goes ahead and puts it in
place.  When reading the actual tree, we see a valid hidden lockfile,
which contains the module, and it doens't have the extraneous flag.  So
everything seems fine.

Remove the hidden lockfile, and the problem presents itself.

Corrected here through some arduous and painstaking manual installs, so
at least we have the tree in the state it *should* be for now.  But this
is a bug in arborist that must be fixed asap.

This removes libnpx, and adds a new command, 'npm exec', which
implements the functionality.  As of this change going live, we are
dropping support for the standalone top-level package 'npx'.

Not all of the functionality of the old version of npx is maintained.

The shell fallback functionality is dropped.  It's insecure, and not
something we want to support or encourage.  If anyone wants it, they
can hack up their .bashrc file themselves.

--no-install is not supported.  If the package is not found locally, it
is installed in a predictable location in the cache, rather than
failing.  This is something we might want to review, as automatically
installing in the case of misspellings may be a security footgun.

--ignore-existing is dropped.  Existing packages are always given
priority.

--quiet or -q can be accomplished by using the --silent npm option, so
it's also dropped.

--npm option is dropped.  npx will always use the npm that it ships
with.

--node-arg is dropped.  There are other ways to set node options via
environment variables in the Node.js versions we support.

--always-spawn is dropped.  npx will always spawn a child process to
execute commands.

The --shell option can be accomplished by using the --script-shell npm
option.

--version and --help are just passed through to npm.

As an added bonus, I noticed that the files in `bin/` were not getting
run.  So now we have full coverage for npm-cli.js and npx-cli.js.

Prevent a global install from overwriting bins and manpages if they are
not links/shims that npm controls, or if then are links/shims to
packages other than the one being installed.

Changes error message output on EEXIST errors to be more helpful.

Related:

- https://github.com/npm/bin-links/pull/12
- https://github.com/npm/gentle-fs/pull/7

Note: this does NOT prevent packages from overwriting one another's bins
in non-global package installs, because doing so would introduce a
[dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) that
npm 6 is not capable of avoiding without significant refactoring.  The
collision detection in npm v7's tree building will enable us to explore
such an option, by never placing dependencies in the same place if they
would write the same bin script.  (It's fundamentally similar to
peerDependency resolution, but much simpler.)

Since users have not complained about this potential foot-gun in the
last 5 years, its unlikely that it is a significant issue, and
introducing additional dependency nesting (or worse, failing installs
for unresolveable trees) is likely an even worse hazard.  If we do
prevent non-global-top installs from overwriting one another's bins, it
ought to be done only as best-effort (ie, allow the collision if both
deps need to be placed in the same node_modules folder) and perhaps
opt-in with a config flag.""",0,changed

7576,"""fix root-ownership race conditions in meta-test

Currently all of our tests verify on teardown that there are no
root-owned files in the cache.

However, owing to some race conditions and slippery stream event
deferral behavior that won't be fixed until v7, occasionally cacache's
chown doesn't get processed until _after_ the promise resolves and the
test ends.

As a result, sometimes this check occurs before the chown has happened,
resulting in flaky hard-to-reproduce failures.

The somewhat-kludgey solution here is to move the ownership check from
t.teardown to process.on('exit').  In npm v7, we should move it back to
t.teardown, because we should never have a test that resolves in such a
way as to leave the cache in an invalid state.

This addresses the issue when people fail to install binary packages on
Docker and other environments where there is no 'nobody' user.

The Config.loadUid() method was failing in these cases, but not in a way
that was particularly informative.  Furthermore, the uid and gid
resolved in that way were just ignored and never stored anywhere.

However, until npm-lifecycle@3.1.3, an error from uid-number was _also_
ignored, so if we didn't crash somewhere, then it would run scripts as
root when provided with an invalid user.  This is arguably fine, but it
is a violation of the contract that the npm CLI presents.

As of npm-lifecycle@3.1.3, these errors are handled properly in
npm-lifecycle, so the additional uninformative crash is no longer doing
anything.  This commit removes that uninformative crash.  This also
means that we won't fail _until_ an invalid user config is actually
relevant; if someone never runs an install script (or runs with
--ignore-scripts), then it's not relevant, so we can move forward
anyway.""",0,fixed

7669,"""Handle unhandledRejections, help with cache eacces

Suggested by @godmar in
https://npm.community/t/npm-err-cb-never-called-permission-denied/9167/5

Incidentally, this turned up that we're catching uncaughtExceptions in
the main npm functions, but not unhandledRejections!

Tracing this through, it seems like node-fetch-npm's use of cacache is
particularly brittle.  Any throw that comes from cacache is not caught
properly, since node-fetch-npm is all streams and callbacks.  The naive
approach (just adding a catch and failing the callback) doesn't work,
because then make-fetch-happen and npm-registry-fetch interpret the
failure as an invalid response, when actually it was a local cache
error.

So, a bit more love and polish is definitely still needed in the
guts of npm's fetching and caching code paths.  In the meantime, though,
handling any unhandledRejection at the top level prevents at least the
worst and most useless type of error message.

When running as sudo (without the -H flag), the HOME environment

The correct-mkdir module was reading env.HOME to determine the
appropriate uid and gid for files written to the cache folder.

However, this is rarely correct.  In practice, this module was reading
env.SUDO_UID and env.SUDO_GID in some cases, but matching ownership on
/var/root in others.

This patch changes correct-mkdir to match the behavior of cacache v12,
where ownership of a file or folder is inferred from the ownership of
its nearest parent directory.""",0,changed

This requires that all tests use `common.cache` as their cache folder,

It also adds a `sudotest` target which runs the tests as root, and then
verifies that no root-owned files have been dropped into the cache.

Lastly, several setup() and cleanup() methods have been removed, as they
are largely unnecessary.  common-tap does all the required setup for
test package directories and cache folders, and removing the cache
avoids the root-ownership test, which is an important integration
requirement.""",0,fixed

Several changes to the test suite to support running tests in parallel,

- Replace all literal 1337 and 1234 ports with a custom per-process port

- Add common.pkg as a per-test working directory instead of polluting
  __dirname or accidentally reusing the same working directory for
  multiple tests.
- Rework test config handling so that tests don't rely on config setup
  being run in a particular order.
- Remove the npm-registry-couchapp tests, since it (a) relies on
  CouchDB, (b) is no longer a reliable indicator of registry
  compatibility, and (c) is already superceded in most cases by tests
  that use npm-registry-mock.  (A test suite that runs against a
  reference implementation is a thing that should exist, but not here.)
- Remove the fake-registry logging when TAP_CHILD_ID is set, since this
  is extremely hard to make sense of when running multiple tests in
  parallel.

When Node v6 compatibility is dropped in npm v7, we can upgrade to the
latest version of tap for a bit more speed, dropping Domains (and the
associated deprecation warnings), and a fancier test reporter.""",0,added

This fixes https://npm.community/t/unhelpful-error-message-when-publishing-without-logging-in-error-eperm-operation-not-permitted-unlink/1377/3 and the other dozen or so issues that that link references, and possibly many more involving poor error messages from errors thrown by the upload function. 

@zkat you mentioned you could take a look at any fixes / answer any questions, if you could look this over and let me know if this is a good / valid approach that would be fantastic, thanks! (it wasn't a race condition, luckily :P).

it may also be helpful to add something like 
```
    if (!auth.token || !(auth.username && auth.password)) {
      log.warn('publish', 'not logged in')
    }
```
just before we even open the first file descriptor to make sure that even if the error message is completely wrong something in the log will give users a clue what may be going on. I took the method of looking for login creds from the logout method, I'm not sure that's valid or if alternatives to npm exist that don't require credentials but users could still publish to.

Triage of the issue:

1. The upload function throws an error
2. As that error bubbles through [cacache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cacache#with-tmp) it tries to delete the tmpdir as it should
3. It can't delete the temp dir as the upload function's readFileStream to the tar it was trying to upload is still open.
4. [cacache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cacache#with-tmp) throws an error about it's inability to remove the dir, which suppresses the upload function's error.

I found this page useful for setting up npm command completion. Thank you npm 
documentation team.

This suggested changed is based on my system which runs Ubuntu where
the completion directory path for bash is found in 
/etc/bash_completion.d and not /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d

I dug around docs for this in The Bash Manual 
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Programmable-Completion 
and on some an old (sadly retired) Debian Admin Site
https://debian-administration.org/article/317/An_introduction_to_bash_completion_part_2

which seemed supportive of the dir being in /etc but I do not have access 
to an OS X machine where I guess bash_completion.d could be in /usr/local/etc 
so I left it in.

`npm audit` currently exits with exit code 1 if any vulnerabilities are found of any level.

Add a flag of `--audit-level` to `npm audit` to allow it to pass if only vulnerabilities below a certain level are found.

Example: `npm audit --audit-level=high` will exit with 0 if only low or moderate level vulns are detected.

8066,"""config: Search for authentication token defined by environment variable (#8)

As discussed on npm.community[1], the fact that
npm registry authentication tokens
cannot be defined using environment variables
does not seem justified anymore.

The restriction is caused by the config loader translating
* all `_` to `-`
* the whole variable name to lowercase
while the credential checker expects a key ending in `:_authToken`.

This change fixes the problem
by having the credential checker try
a key ending in `:-authtoken` after it tried `:_authToken`.

https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3aaa6ef427b7a34ebc49cd656e188b5befc22bae
already uses `npm-pick-manifest` in such a way, and this patch guarantees that `pacote` itself

this option isn't passed through.

The tests in `test/tap/lifecycle-signal.js`, as well as the features

being skipped in CI to being disabled only for certain platforms.

In particular, because `npm` spawns its lifecycle scripts in a
shell, signals are not necessarily forwarded by the shell and
won’t cause scripts to exit; also, shells may report the signal
they receive using their exit status, rather than terminating
themselves with a signal.

This reverts commit 06c154fd653d18725d2e760ba825d43cdd807420.

This caused problems because folks were using peer deps to indicate that the
target of the peer dep needed to be able to require the dependency and had
been relying on the fact that peer deps didn't change the shape of the tree
(as of npm@3).

The fix that will actually work for people is for a peer dep to insist on
never being installed deeper than the the thing it relies on.  At the moment
this is tricky because the thing the peer dep relies on may not yet have
been added to the tree, so we don't know where it is.""",0,changed

`npm install foo` or `npm rm foo` and don't have a `node_modules` but do have
a `package-lock.json` it's gonna install everything from the
`package-lock.json` in addition to making your change.

The one thing we won't do is update your package-lock from your
package.json.  We only do that when you request a full install.

This does not change the behavior if you don't have a lock file.

9284,"""publish: simplify lifecycle invocation

Previously (in 0ab0c112b94e5a7ee921663ac5db73396adb8617) support was
added for running the publish and postpublish lifecycle scripts. Some
work was done to ensure that this was run in the correct path both when
publishing from the package's working directory, as well as when
publishing from a package tarball file or URL. The latter case is
interesting, because it would only ever work for lifecycle scripts that
didn't rely on bins exported by (dev)dependencies, due to being run
directly from the cached package.json. In the process, there was a lot
of inline use of ternary operators that made it very hard to understand
what was going on.

There are two ways to fix this:

1. An expensive way, which is to explode the package once it's been
   cached, install it, and then run the lifecycle scripts from that
   directory.
2. A cheap way, which is to assume that whatever scripts needed to be
   run were already run when packing the tarball or remote package, and
   just don't run the lifecycle scripts at all unless you're publishing
   from the working directory.

This patch opts for approach #2. Publishing directly from tarballs is an
option for power users, and having lifecycle events fire in that case is
a conflation of the build and upload stages of publish that cuts against
what (I believe) most users are trying to do, which is to build an
artifact, certify it, and then only publish it if certification
succeeds.

However, this is technically a breaking change, and as such should
either ship before `npm@4` becomes latest, or be held for `npm@5`. (I'd
prefer the former, but leave that for the team to decide.)

behaviour with respect to adding the directory of

that `npm` will invoke a different `node` executable than the
one which it is running.

This is a non-invasive solution to some of the problems described in
https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12318. It should not come with
any drawbacks for npm’s side, as it shifts the responsibility of
making sure that the `PATH` variable contains everything it should
to whoever invoked npm with `--scripts-prepend-node-path=false`.

While https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12968 may have addressed some
of the problems described there, it does not help in the case that
the `PATH` has explicitly been overridden with the intention of
having a different `node` executed.

[squash] test: anticipate coverage tooling possibly setting --scripts-prepend-node-path

As one of the motivations for introducing `--scripts-prepend-node-path`
is that `spawn-wrap` (which npm itself uses for coverage) can make use
of that option, anticipate that change in order to not break the
test suite when updating that dependency at a later point.

[squash] tests for scripts-prepend-node-path=auto

[squash] implement `warn-only` setting for `--scripts-prepend-node-path`

Adds a setting that is basically equivalent to `--scripts-prepend-node-path=false`
but emits a warning informing the user about the existence of the
option in the cases in which `npm` currently modifies `PATH`,
as sometimes that’s in the user’s interest.

When you depend on a tag, eg `foo@latest`, your `npm-shrinkwrap.json` will
record this in its `_from` field. Similarly when you depend on a git dependency
with something like `github:foo/bar` it saves this to your `_from`.

When you install under the above circumstances the installed module will be
installed from the associated tarball URL for tagged dependencies or git URL
with commit hash for git dependencies.

As a result the `_requested` section of the `package.json` will be based on
the tarball URL or githash and cann't be matched up to the `package.json`.

It was _supposed_ to fallback to comparing the `package.json` `_from` field
with but it was doing this by comparing `rawSpec` to `_from`, which _can't_
work consistently.

Instead it now just directly checks and then records that its done so on the

expanded via shrinkwrap don't go through this– `inflateShrinkwrap` does not
currently have any rollback semantics and so checking this sort of thing there

We keep track of missing dependencies and missing dev dependencies
separately. This allows things like `npm ls` to make decisions about what
it wants to warn about.

Despite having concrete lists of dependencies and dev dependencies we were
guessing as to which was which. This _usually_ works fine, but in cases where
dependencies and dev dependencies share a requirement but not precisely the
same version, it could lead to misleading error messages.

Further, things in the shrinkwrap that are not in the package.json were not being
reported at all.

This change does two things:

1. It rewrites `markDeps` to take an object with name, spec & kind (`prod`
   or `dev`). Previously it took a string of `name@spec` and extracted name
   & spec from that.
2. When a dependency is both a prod and a dev dep, it will be correctly
   categorized. Previously if the dev spec didn't match it would still be
   flagged as a prod mismatch.

If `ls` for a package without using a semver filter,
for example, `npm ls foo` vs `foo@1.2.3`, `ls` was using semver
ranges based on `*`, which doesn't match prerelease versions.

So, if you had installed a prerelease version (`foo@1.2.3-xyz`),
the `npm ls` will return no results for `foo`, at all.

This patch bypasses the semver check entirely when there's no semver
filter for the search.

9652,"""test: fix Windows-specific test issues

This commit is a squash of many other commits. They all act on
individual tests. Some of them have notable messages, which are
preserved below:

test: rewrite verify-no-lifecycle-on-repo to work on windows

On windows, the previous version of this would open a new cmd window, run
echo in it, and then leave it there, interactive, and wait for the window to
be closed.

test: Fix gently-rm-linked-module on windows

We just need to make our link explicitly be a junction.  This will work as
long as you run tests on NTFS.  It does NOT work on, for instance, vbox
shared folders.

test: Fix gently-rm-symlinked-global-dir to work on windows

To do this we needed to do three things:
1. Be aware that npm doesn't use the same global path structure on
windows. (No lib, bin, etc, all flat.)
2. Not tie the tests to platform-specific unicode support
3. Create our links as junctions, so ordinary users can make them

test: Rewrite lifecycle-path to use `npm run env`

This test predates the existence of `npm run env`-- by changing to use
it we both get to get rid of an unneeded fixture and fix things to
work on windows.

test: fix config-edit on windows

`child_process.spawn`, which is what the `editor` package uses
does not support running straight-up scripts on Windows. Only `.exe`s

For this reason, it's better to just explicitly use `node` here.

test: Fix publish-access-unscoped-restricted-fails on windows

This involved switching from a direct integration test to using common.npm,
as the former method wasn't resulting in all files being closed which meant
that `rimraf` of the test dir couldn't finish on Windows.

test: Don't Object.keys on non typeof == object

`Object.keys` is valid on any non-null, not undefined value in current
versions of Node.js, but older versions would throw an error for any
non typeof == object.

test: fix gently-rm-linked-module when run from `npm run tap`

`npm run tap` sets the npm_config_prefix env var, which was
overriding the test's own attempt at setting the prefix (via the
PREFIX env var).

This was fixed in fstream-npm@1.0.6 from via d82ff81403, but for some
reason the internal tar code duplicated this logic. Removing the
duplication passes all the tests, so seems prudent.

While fixing this bug, it was noticed that the `files-and-ignores` tests
were giving false positives because they use `npm install` instead of
only `npm pack`, the tests have been modified to avoid this.

9791,"""npm-bin: Prefer locally installed npm in Git Bash.

Existing behavior invoking npm within a Git Bash session is to prefer
the globally installed instance of `npm`; the instance of npm installed
alongside Node when using the Node installer.

The cmd script, and the shell script, have been modified in the past to
pull a `prefix` setting from the global `npmrc` file, and invoke the
`npm` instance located at the `prefix` location. Because the value of
`prefix` is the user's AppData directory where npm installs new copies
of itself, the user gets the latest installed npm.

However, the setup was not extended to support Git Bash. Therefore Git
Bash users still get the version of npm installed beside Node.

Add support for using the same prefix for invoking the user installed
npm in Git Bash sessions.

Previously, correctMkdir() would cache the results early within its
operation (after the stat, before calling chownr) meaning that any second
call would immediately return the cached results, before the earlier chownr
finishes.  This causes a race condition where the initial chownr would fail
with ENOENT (or similar errors) trying to scan files that were being
actively created/deleted/etc by the install process.  The fix guards the
whole correctMkdir function with inflight() so that multiple calls do not do
chownr simultaneously nor return early.  It would also be reasonable to not
cache the results until after the chownr has finished, however that would
still lead to an even more subtle race condition, so the guard on the whole
call is required.

This rejiggers bundled modules, such that they're moved out of the bundling
module's folder at extract time and places in staging by themselves like any
other module. This allows the rest of npm to pretend they're normal modules,
which lets us remove a whole host of special cases and overall simplifies
our code.

Fixes: #10482

So if you had:
```
a bundles b requres c
```
And the version of bundled `c` in `b` doesn't match the `package.json` it
will end up installing a new copy of `c` under `b` and ditching the contents
of `b`.

10021,"""deps: Make failure of deps of extraneous deps fail

When a non-optional dep fails, we have to walk up the requiredBy tree to see
if its descended only from optional dependencies. If it ISN'T then
we fail at this point, if it IS then we just mark those ancestors and
their children as failed and call it a day.

This brings us to the case of modules the user installed but didn't --save.
These modules don't have any ancestors from a requiredBy perspective and as
such, we never hit the top level module which is where we ordinarily stop.
As such, we need to short circuit– if a descendent of a user installed dep
fails then we need to fail the install.

The install order is determined by:

1) The location of the thing to be installed relative to the root module.
2) Dependency order, such that a -> b -> c will install modules as: c, b, a

1 is deterministic, regardless of what's being installed.

But 2 can change the order of things higher in the dep tree.  Eg, b, or a
might get sorted earlier if c requires them.  This mostly doesn't matter,
but it does mean that if you have two modules with conflicting bins, they
_can_ get installed in different orders.  This changes sorts all of the top
level modules to be LAST, in location order (1), and then sorts all the rest
per (2).  This ensures that top level modules have a deterministic install
order. (Non top level modules can't have bin conflicts as that's treated
the same as a version conflict and the conflicting module would be hoisted.)

/d disables cmd.exe AutoRuns feature, where registry entry points to the

scripts to fail, since relative path to the script no longer works (and
package.json has no way to deduce absolute path)

/s enables handling of quotes, so that you can have ""C:\Program
Files\Node\node.exe"" quoted in your script. Node's child_process.exec()
is doing the same. We prevent additional quoting by libuv already by
setting uv_spawn() flag UV_PROCESS_WINDOWS_VERBATIM_ARGUMENTS.

If those flags are not set there is no way package.json can reliably
tell us to run ""node"" executable with a relative script path:

    ""scripts"": {
      ""install"": ""node scripts/install.js""
    }

Without /d ""node"" invocation may end up in a random directory as a

2. This moves checks to be at ""install"" time (resolveWithNewModule), so
they happen earlier.

3. Arguments passed in from the command line are checked even earlier.

This is a huge set of mostly mechanical changes. Going forward, all
changes to the npm source base are expected to comply with `standard`,
and it's been integrated into the test suite to enforce that. There are
a few notes below about specific classes of changes that need to be
handled specially for npm's code base.

standard: ""Expected error to be handled.""

`standard` only expects errors spelled ""err"" to be handled.
`npm-registry-mock` never actually invokes its callback with an error,
so in some cases I just changed it to be spelled ""er"" and called it
good.

standard: ""Expected a ""break"" statement before 'case'.""

This behavior is actually on purpose, and I don't feel like rewriting
the affected code right now (or, you know, ever). So I added code
comments disabling the checks in the three applicable changes.

standard: ""x is a function.""

Rebinding functions created via declarations (as opposed to expressions)
is a no-no?

10819,"""Upgrade to tap v1

node-tap v1.0.0 introduces a bunch of consistency and functionality
upgrades in the test experience, along with a suite of pretty reporters
ported from Mocha's default set.

The semantic change that most dramatically affects npm's use (and will
likely cause a bit of wailing and gnashing of teeth among other tap
users) is that 't.test(...)' is now executed immediately, as long as
there is not another test currently in progress.  Indeed, everything
that the Test class does, it does right away at the moment of calling
the function, never using nextTick to defer anything.

This means that, for example, a 'console.log' in the middle of a bunch
of tests will print its output in the context of the associated test
output, instead of having the console.log happen first, and then all of
the TAP data deferred until later.

For new node-tap users, this has been a significant stumbling block.
However, it is a breaking change, and requires that test fixture objects
have to be set up in advance of being used by a test, since it's no
longer a guarantee that everything at the top (module) level will be
executed before any test blocks.

Also, the statSync in config-meta was changed to an lstatSync, since I
have been developing with tap link-installed, and the directory crawling
was sending my system into a tailspin otherwise.  It seems like this
would happen any time one of the npm deps was link-installed, so it's
probably a good idea anyway.""",0,changed

It's too difficult for npm contributors to figure out what the
conventional style is for tests. Part of the problem is that the
documentation in CONTRIBUTING.md is inadequate, but another important
factor is that the tests themselves are written in a variety of styles.
One of the most notable examples of this is the fact that many tests use
fixture directories to store precooked test scenarios and package.json
files.

This had some negative consequences:

  * tests weren't idempotent
  * subtle dependencies between tests existed
  * new tests get written in this deprecated style because it's not
    obvious that the style is out of favor
  * it's hard to figure out why a lot of those directories existed,
    because they served a variety of purposes, so it was difficult to
    tell when it was safe to remove them

All in all, the fixture directories were a major source of technical
debt, and cleaning them up, while time-consuming, makes the whole test
suite much more approachable, and makes it more likely that new tests
written by outside contributors will follow a conventional style. To
support that, all of the tests touched by this changed were cleaned up
to pass the `standard` style checker.""",0,added

Fixes #7552.

The npm@<3 installer uses an elaborate data tree built in-memory as the
install process runs to track which dependencies have already been seen
in the tree. This allows the installer to determine whether a parent
dependency satisfies the current semver requirement.

However, if one version of a dependency is specified at one level of the
tree, and then a child of that level includes that same dependency
bundled at a different version, and one of *that dependency's* children
depends on this same dependency at yet another version, it will end up
matching against the version _above_ the bundled dependency.  This can
lead anyone trying to figure out what's going on into a phantasmagorical
wonderland where nothing is real, and can also produce an inconsistent
installed tree.

The solution is to ensure that the bundled dependency versions are added
to the tree, but in order to do this, we need to know exactly which
version got bundled. This requires a call to readInstalled, because the
version that was bundled isn't included anywhere in the package
metadata. Since readInstalled is slow, installMany will only call it if
it knows there are bundledDependencies for the current package.""",0,added

Fixes #7579.

We want to know two things with gently-rm:

1. Is the parent directory under npm's control?
(1a. Is the thing to be deleted under that parent directory if so?)
2. Is the thing to be deleted under npm's control?

There are some additional complications, but that's the core of it, so
to make clearer what was going on, I rearranged the code to prioritize
answering those two questions, and added a bunch of comments explaining
what's happening in an effort that that would make clearer *why* the
code is written the way it is.

When npm removes a file or directory, it verifies whether the thing
being removed is under npm's control. This isn't something that can be
ascertained directly, so gentlyRm checks to see if there's a plausible
case that this file was something that was originally installed by npm.
Mostly it just verifies whether either the deletion target or the parent
directory (which could be passed in as the base, or could be the prefix
otherwise) is under one of the paths that npm might have reason to mess
with.

It will also deal with a certain amount of symbolic link trickery, but
symlink verification was overly aggressive before, and has been eased up
some.""",0,added

a71615a accidentally got reverted by 355bb7e, which split the changed

Original commit message:

    Check SHA before using files from cache

    Fixes #3265.

    Because 'npm install' *always* writes every package to the cache (even
    if it isn't installed from the registry) before installing it, it's easy
    to end up in a situation where ""npm install foo"" installs something
    other than the appropriate version from the registry.  eg:

      npm cache clean
      # Install a fork of version 0.0.1:
      npm install https://github.com/glasser/npm-cache-corruption/tarball/93c447e

This does a few things to clean up the error output and make it a bit
more user-friendly (and maintainer friendly!)

1. Remove the 'npm ERR code 0' at the bottom.  We're not exiting with
code 0, so that's just confusing and weird.  It just means that we don't
YET have an error code, so it's better to just omit it.

2. Never print out stack traces at loglevel=error.  They're too verbose,
and send users into a brain-shutdown-overload panic which is
uncomfortable and not a very nice to do to them.

3. Since most users jump to the bottom of an error report and read
increased importance in the last line, reorder the output a bit.

  a. The system/version/argv info is printed first, where it'll be
  mostly ignored by users but still output by default for the benefit of
  support staff.  This is useful for us, but just excess noise for them,
  since they presumably already know what operating system they're
  using, etc.

  b. Next, print out the human-friendly error message for things we
  know, like ""the script exited with such and such error code, it's a
  bug with the fooblz package, get the owner info with blah blah"", etc.

  c. Last, we print out the npm-debug.log file, but instead of just
  saying ""Additional debugging info is available"", we explicitly ask the
  user to attach it to any support request.  This is generally always
  the first thing we ask for, so we may as well just go ahead and ask
  for it here.

4. Corrected a few blatantly un-helpful suggestions (like using
unpublish to get around a publish version conflict.)""",0,fixed

Fixes #5591

The root cause here is that a change from 022 (a number in octal literal
format) to '022' (a string) caused the string to later be interpreted as
a decimal number, making for some wacky umask values.

Solution is multipart.

First, use the actual process.umask() value from the user's environment.
This is almost certainly what they want anyway.

Second, validate all default values just like we do with user- supplied
values, rather than trusting them to never be wrong.  This would've
found the problem much sooner, while in dev.

This second part requires that we allow a value of null for 'path' type
args, allow 'undefined' for the 'local-address' config, and avoid
looking up a cafile of 'null', all of which are good hygenic things to
add defense-in-depth anyway.""",0,changed

This way, if an `npm test` script (or any other lifecycle process) ends
up exiting because of a signal like a SIGSEGV, then npm will exit the same
way (since the `code` will be null when a signal is present), and not
obscure the signal the occurred.

For example, given this `package.json` file:

``` json
{
  ""name"": ""sigsegv"",
  ""version"": ""0.0.0"",
  ""scripts"": {
    ""test"": ""node -e 'process.kill(process.pid, \""SIGSEGV\"")'""
  }
}

Before this patch, npm would obscure the seg fault exit status:

```
$ npm test

> sigsegv@0.0.0 test /Users/nrajlich/t
> node -e 'process.kill(process.pid, ""SIGSEGV"")'

$ echo $?
0
```

After this patch, the proper signal is relayed to npm, and thus the shell:

```
$ node ../npm/bin/npm-cli.js test

> sigsegv@0.0.0 test /Users/nrajlich/t
> node -e 'process.kill(process.pid, ""SIGSEGV"")'

This is a pretty significant clean-up of many relics.

Once upon a time, npm was only one or two commands, and when you needed

write a file, you wrote it yourself.  Uphill in the snow.  Yeah.

Then, modernity arrived, and things got abstracted.  Now, instead of
writing your own file, the kids today with their rock and roll music and
their hair and their marijuana cigarettes, you know what they do?  They
call some external utility to write it FOR them!

x.x.x matches anything

1 --> 1.x.x
1.x --> 1.x.x

Spermies:

The spermy operator is ""~>"" or ""~"".  It does ""sane"" matching from the
specified version up through the version that increases the Major or
minor version number by 1.

This has the odd and slightly inelegant effect that ~1.2 and ~1.2.0 are
the same exact thing.  But, whatever.  It's a standard.  Blame rubygems.

This adds two things:

1. When creating a tarball in the cache at
.npm/.cache/name/version/package.tgz, also calculate a shasum of the
data, and add it to the cached data.  This is what is used when
publishing, so that's what ends up in the registry, and is based on the
actual tarball which is uploaded.

2. When downloading a tarball from the registry, and saving it to a
temporary location, validate that the temporary tarball file's shasum
matches what is stored in the registry.

It is possible to make this much more efficient, simpler, and more
secure, in the following ways:

1. Whenever unpacking a tarball in the unpackTar function, the bytes are
being passed from the FileReadStream into a gzip child process.  Those
bytes could be forked to the sha1 Hash at that time.
2. When a package is uploaded, the bytes are pumped to an http request.
They could be hashed at that time, and then added to the published json
data right before the second write.
3. When a tarball is downloaded, the bytes are pumped from the http
request to a (manual) FileWriteStream.  They could be hashed there and
tested at the end of the download.

Ideally, there should be some checksumming pump function that npm used
internally that would capture the state of every pump action, and
provide the shasum to the callback.  Then, it would even be possible to
shasum the gzipped tarball, as well as the tar file itself, and
eventually perhaps even all of the files within.""",0,added

Building more upon the patch from Charlie Robbins (d7c69821a01c8327f5468fe7a115f2537f908da9), these changes remove any way of npm actually triggering a program exit than by being called by the cli.

- Move the ""exit"" option off the opts object and onto a proper config setting.  Why not?
- Use \r\n for most output, so that it'll look correct in the repl, or other places where \n may not be enough.

However, there is no other single place where npm accesses those folders at the moment, so this is the easiest way to ensure that these things exist.
